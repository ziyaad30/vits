C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0001.wav|printing, in the only sense with which we are at present concerned, differs from most if not from all the arts and crafts represented in the exhibition
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0002.wav|in being comparatively modern.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0003.wav|for although the chinese took impressions from wood blocks engraved in relief for centuries before the woodcutters of the netherlands, by a similar process
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0004.wav|produced the block books, which were the immediate predecessors of the true printed book,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0005.wav|the invention of movable metal letters in the middle of the fifteenth century may justly be considered as the invention of the art of printing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0006.wav|and it is worth mention in passing that, as an example of fine typography,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0007.wav|the earliest book printed with movable types, the gutenberg, or "forty two line bible" of about fourteen fifty five,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0008.wav|has never been surpassed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0009.wav|printing, then, for our purpose, may be considered as the art of making books by means of movable types.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0010.wav|now, as all books not primarily intended as picture books consist principally of types composed to form letterpress,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0011.wav|it is of the first importance that the letter used should be fine in form;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0012.wav|especially as no more time is occupied, or cost incurred, in casting, setting, or printing beautiful letters
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0013.wav|than in the same operations with ugly ones.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0014.wav|and it was a matter of course that in the middle ages, when the craftsmen took care that beautiful form should always be a part of their productions whatever they were,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0015.wav|the forms of printed letters should be beautiful, and that their arrangement on the page should be reasonable and a help to the shapeliness of the letters themselves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0016.wav|the middle ages brought calligraphy to perfection, and it was natural therefore
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0017.wav|that the forms of printed letters should follow more or less closely those of the written character, and they followed them very closely.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0018.wav|the first books were printed in black letter, i.e. the letter which was a gothic development of the ancient roman character,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0019.wav|and which developed more completely and satisfactorily on the side of the "lower case" than the capital letters;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0020.wav|the "lower case" being in fact invented in the early middle ages.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0021.wav|the earliest book printed with movable type, the aforesaid gutenberg bible, is printed in letters which are an exact imitation
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0022.wav|of the more formal ecclesiastical writing which obtained at that time; this has since been called "missal type,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0023.wav|and was in fact the kind of letter used in the many splendid missals, psalters, etc., produced by printing in the fifteenth century.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0024.wav|but the first bible actually dated (which also was printed at maintz by peter schoeffer in the year fourteen sixty two)
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0025.wav|imitates a much freer hand, simpler, rounder, and less spiky, and therefore far pleasanter and easier to read.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0026.wav|on the whole the type of this book may be considered the ne plus ultra of gothic type,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0027.wav|especially as regards the lower case letters; and type very similar was used during the next fifteen or twenty years not only by schoeffer,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0028.wav|but by printers in strasburg, basle, paris, lubeck, and other cities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0029.wav|but though on the whole, except in italy, gothic letter was most often used
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0030.wav|a very few years saw the birth of roman character not only in italy, but in germany and france.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0031.wav|in fourteen sixty five sweynheim and pannartz began printing in the monastery of subiaco near rome,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0032.wav|and used an exceedingly beautiful type, which is indeed to look at a transition between gothic and roman,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0033.wav|but which must certainly have come from the study of the twelfth or even the eleventh century mss.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0034.wav|they printed very few books in this type, three only; but in their very first books in rome, beginning with the year fourteen sixty eight,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0035.wav|they discarded this for a more completely roman and far less beautiful letter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0036.wav|but about the same year mentelin at strasburg began to print in a type which is distinctly roman;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0037.wav|and the next year gunther zeiner at augsburg followed suit;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0038.wav|while in fourteen seventy at paris udalric gering and his associates turned out the first books printed in france, also in roman character.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0039.wav|the roman type of all these printers is similar in character,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0040.wav|and is very simple and legible, and unaffectedly designed for use; but it is by no means without beauty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0041.wav|it must be said that it is in no way like the transition type of subiaco,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0042.wav|and though more roman than that, yet scarcely more like the complete roman type of the earliest printers of rome.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0043.wav|a further development of the roman letter took place at venice.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0044.wav|john of spires and his brother vindelin, followed by nicholas jenson, began to print in that city,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0045.wav|fourteen sixty nine, fourteen seventy;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0046.wav|their type is on the lines of the german and french rather than of the roman printers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0047.wav|of jenson it must be said that he carried the development of roman type as far as it can go:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0048.wav|his letter is admirably clear and regular, but at least as beautiful as any other roman type.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0049.wav|after his death in the "fourteen eighties," or at least by fourteen ninety, printing in venice had declined very much;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0050.wav|and though the famous family of aldus restored its technical excellence, rejecting battered letters,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0051.wav|and paying great attention to the "press work" or actual process of printing,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0052.wav|yet their type is artistically on a much lower level than jenson's, and in fact
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0053.wav|they must be considered to have ended the age of fine printing in italy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0054.wav|jenson, however, had many contemporaries who used beautiful type,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0055.wav|some of which as, e.g., that of jacobus rubeus or jacques le rouge is scarcely distinguishable from his.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0056.wav|it was these great venetian printers, together with their brethren of rome, milan,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0057.wav|parma, and one or two other cities, who produced the splendid editions of the classics, which are one of the great glories of the printer's art,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0058.wav|and are worthy representatives of the eager enthusiasm for the revived learning of that epoch. by far,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0059.wav|the greater part of these italian printers, it should be mentioned, were germans or frenchmen, working under the influence of italian opinion and aims.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0060.wav|it must be understood that through the whole of the fifteenth and the first quarter of the sixteenth centuries
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0061.wav|the roman letter was used side by side with the gothic.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0062.wav|even in italy most of the theological and law books were printed in gothic letter,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0063.wav|which was generally more formally gothic than the printing of the german workmen,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0064.wav|many of whose types, indeed, like that of the subiaco works, are of a transitional character.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0065.wav|this was notably the case with the early works printed at ulm, and in a somewhat lesser degree at augsburg.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0066.wav|in fact gunther zeiner's first type (afterwards used by schussler) is remarkably like the type of the before mentioned subiaco books.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0067.wav|in the low countries and cologne, which were very fertile of printed books, gothic was the favorite.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0068.wav|the characteristic dutch type, as represented by the excellent printer gerard leew, is very pronounced and uncompromising gothic.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0069.wav|this type was introduced into england by wynkyn de worde, caxton's successor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0070.wav|and was used there with very little variation all through the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, and indeed into the eighteenth.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0071.wav|most of caxton's own types are of an earlier character, though they also much resemble flemish or cologne letter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0072.wav|after the end of the fifteenth century the degradation of printing, especially in germany and italy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0073.wav|went on apace; and by the end of the sixteenth century there was no really beautiful printing done:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0074.wav|the best, mostly french or low country, was neat and clear, but without any distinction;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0075.wav|the worst, which perhaps was the english, was a terrible falling off from the work of the earlier presses;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0076.wav|and things got worse and worse through the whole of the seventeenth century, so that in the eighteenth printing was very miserably performed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0077.wav|in england about this time, an attempt was made (notably by caslon, who started business in london as a type founder in seventeen twenty)
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0078.wav|to improve the letter in form.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0079.wav|caslon's type is clear and neat, and fairly well designed;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0080.wav|he seems to have taken the letter of the elzevirs of the seventeenth century for his model:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0081.wav|type cast from his matrices is still in everyday use.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0082.wav|in spite, however, of his praiseworthy efforts, printing had still one last degradation to undergo.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0083.wav|the seventeenth century founts were bad rather negatively than positively.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0084.wav|but for the beauty of the earlier work they might have seemed tolerable.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0085.wav|it was reserved for the founders of the later eighteenth century to produce letters which are positively ugly, and which, it may be added,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0086.wav|are dazzling and unpleasant to the eye owing to the clumsy thickening and vulgar thinning of the lines:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0087.wav|for the seventeenth century letters are at least pure and simple in line. the italian, bodoni, and the frenchman, didot,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0088.wav|were the leaders in this luckless change, though our own baskerville, who was at work some years before them, went much on the same lines;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0089.wav|but his letters, though uninteresting and poor, are not nearly so gross and vulgar as those of either the italian or the frenchman.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0090.wav|with this change the art of printing touched bottom,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0091.wav|so far as fine printing is concerned, though paper did not get to its worst till about eighteen forty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0092.wav|the chiswick press in eighteen forty four revived caslon's founts, printing for messrs. longman the diary of lady willoughby.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0093.wav|this experiment was so far successful that about eighteen fifty messrs. miller and richard of edinburgh
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0094.wav|were induced to cut punches for a series of "old style" letters.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0095.wav|these and similar founts, cast by the above firm and others,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0096.wav|have now come into general use and are obviously a great improvement on the ordinary "modern style" in use in england, which is in fact the bodoni type
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0097.wav|a little reduced in ugliness. the design of the letters of this modern "old style" leaves a good deal to be desired,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0098.wav|and the whole effect is a little too gray, owing to the thinness of the letters.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0099.wav|it must be remembered, however, that most modern printing is done by machinery on soft paper, and not by the hand press,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0100.wav|and these somewhat wiry letters are suitable for the machine process, which would not do justice to letters of more generous design.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0101.wav|it is discouraging to note that the improvement of the last fifty years is almost wholly confined to great britain.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0102.wav|here and there a book is printed in france or germany with some pretension to good taste,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0103.wav|but the general revival of the old forms has made no way in those countries.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0104.wav|italy is contentedly stagnant.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0105.wav|america has produced a good many showy books, the typography, paper, and illustrations of which are, however, all wrong,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0106.wav|oddity rather than rational beauty and meaning being apparently the thing sought for both in the letters and the illustrations.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0107.wav|to say a few words on the principles of design in typography:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0108.wav|it is obvious that legibility is the first thing to be aimed at in the forms of the letters;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0109.wav|this is best furthered by the avoidance of irrational swellings and spiky projections, and by the using of careful purity of line.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0110.wav|even the caslon type when enlarged shows great shortcomings in this respect:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0111.wav|the ends of many of the letters such as the t and e are hooked up in a vulgar and meaningless way,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0112.wav|instead of ending in the sharp and clear stroke of jenson's letters;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0113.wav|there is a grossness in the upper finishings of letters like the c, the a, and so on,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0114.wav|an ugly pear shaped swelling defacing the form of the letter:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0115.wav|in short, it happens to this craft, as to others, that the utilitarian practice, though it professes to avoid ornament,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0116.wav|still clings to a foolish, because misunderstood conventionality, deduced from what was once ornament, and is by no means useful;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0117.wav|which title can only be claimed by artistic practice, whether the art in it be conscious or unconscious.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0118.wav|in no characters is the contrast between the ugly and vulgar illegibility of the modern type
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0119.wav|and the elegance and legibility of the ancient more striking than in the arabic numerals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0120.wav|in the old print each figure has its definite individuality, and one cannot be mistaken for the other;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0121.wav|in reading the modern figures the eyes must be strained before the reader can have any reasonable assurance
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0122.wav|that he has a five, an eight, or a three before him, unless the press work is of the best:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0123.wav|this is awkward if you have to read bradshaw's guide in a hurry.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0124.wav|one of the differences between the fine type and the utilitarian must probably be put down to a misapprehension of a commercial necessity:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0125.wav|this is the narrowing of the modern letters.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0126.wav|most of jenson's letters are designed within a square,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0127.wav|the modern letters are narrowed by a third or thereabout; but while this gain of space very much hampers the possibility of beauty of design,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0128.wav|it is not a real gain, for the modern printer throws the gain away by putting inordinately wide spaces between his lines, which, probably,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0129.wav|the lateral compression of his letters renders necessary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0130.wav|commercialism again compels the use of type too small in size to be comfortable reading:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0131.wav|the size known as "long primer" ought to be the smallest size used in a book meant to be read.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0132.wav|here, again, if the practice of "leading" were retrenched larger type could be used without enhancing the price of a book.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0133.wav|one very important matter in "setting up" for fine printing is the "spacing," that is, the lateral distance of words from one another.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0134.wav|in good printing the spaces between the words should be as near as possible equal
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0135.wav|it is impossible that they should be quite equal except in lines of poetry
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0136.wav|modern printers understand this, but it is only practiced in the very best establishments.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0137.wav|but another point which they should attend to they almost always disregard;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0138.wav|this is the tendency to the formation of ugly meandering white lines or "rivers" in the page

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0149.wav|from the time when books first took their present shape till the end of the sixteenth century, or indeed later,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0150.wav|the page so lay on the paper that there was more space allowed to the bottom and fore margin than to the top and back of the paper,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0152.wav|the modern printer, in the teeth of the evidence given by his own eyes, considers the single page as the unit, and prints the page in the middle of his paper

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0154.wav|the result as measured by the eye being that the lower margin is less than the top one, and that the whole opening has an upside down look vertically
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0155.wav|and that laterally the page looks as if it were being driven off the paper.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0156.wav|the paper on which the printing is to be done is a necessary part of our subject:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0157.wav|of this it may be said that though there is some good paper made now,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0158.wav|it is never used except for very expensive books, although it would not materially increase the cost in all but the very cheapest.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0161.wav|there seems to be no reason why ordinary paper should not be better made,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0162.wav|even allowing the necessity for a very low price; but any improvement must be based on showing openly that the cheap article is cheap,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0163.wav|e.g. the cheap paper should not sacrifice toughness and durability to a smooth and white surface,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0164.wav|which should be indications of a delicacy of material and manufacture which would of necessity increase its cost.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0165.wav|one fruitful source of badness in paper
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0166.wav|is the habit that publishers have of eking out a thin volume by printing it on thick paper almost of the substance of cardboard,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0167.wav|a device which deceives nobody, and makes a book very unpleasant to read.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0168.wav|on the whole, a small book should be printed on paper which is as thin as may be without being transparent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0169.wav|the paper used for printing the small highly ornamented french service books about the beginning of the sixteenth century is a model in this respect,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0170.wav|being thin, tough, and opaque.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0171.wav|however, the fact must not be blinked that machine made paper cannot in the nature of things be made of so good a texture as that made by hand.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0172.wav|the ornamentation of printed books is too wide a subject to be dealt with fully here; but one thing must be said on it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0173.wav|the essential point to be remembered is that the ornament, whatever it is, whether picture or pattern work, should form part of the page,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0174.wav|should be a part of the whole scheme of the book.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0175.wav|simple as this proposition is, it is necessary to be stated,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0176.wav|because the modern practice is to disregard the relation between the printing and the ornament altogether,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0177.wav|so that if the two are helpful to one another it is a mere matter of accident.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0178.wav|the due relation of letter to pictures and other ornament was thoroughly understood by the old printers; so that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0179.wav|even when the woodcuts are very rude indeed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0180.wav|the proportions of the page still give pleasure by the sense of richness that the cuts and letter together convey.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0181.wav|when, as is most often the case, there is actual beauty in the cuts,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0182.wav|the books so ornamented are amongst the most delightful works of art that have ever been produced.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0183.wav|therefore, granted well designed type, due spacing of the lines and words, and proper position of the page on the paper,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ001-0184.wav|all books might be at least comely and well looking: and if to these good qualities were added really beautiful ornament and pictures,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0297.wav|on the master's side it was thirteen and fourpence, and a gallon of beer on entrance, although mister newman,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0299.wav|and gave the garnish for the common side at that sum, which is five shillings more than mister neild says was extorted on the common side.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0300.wav|numerous tyrannies were practiced on all who would not and could not pay the garnish.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0302.wav|and so were unable either to warm themselves or to cook their food.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0303.wav|besides these fees, legitimate and illegitimate, there were others which must be paid before release.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0304.wav|the sheriff demanded four shillings, six pence for his liberate, the jailer six shillings, ten pence more, and the turnkey two shillings;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0309.wav|there was this much honest forbearance in newgate in these days,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0310.wav|that debtors who could afford the cabin and master's side were not permitted to share in the prison charities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0311.wav|these were lumped together into a general fund,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0312.wav|and a calculation made as to the amount that might be expended per week from the whole sum, so that the latter might last out the year.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0313.wav|it generally ran to about six pounds per week. the money, which at one time had been distributed quarterly, and all went in drink,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0314.wav|was after eighteen oh seven, through the exertions of the keeper of the jail, spent in the purchase of necessaries.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0315.wav|but this weekly pittance did not go far when the debtors' side was crowded, as it often was;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0317.wav|and there were as many as three hundred and fifty prisoners in at one time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0318.wav|the city also allowed the poor debtors fourteen ounces of bread daily, and their share of eight stone of meat, an allowance which never varied,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0319.wav|issued once a week, and divided as far as it would go a very precarious and uncertain ration.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0320.wav|the bread was issued every alternate day; and while some prisoners often ate their whole allowance at once,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0321.wav|others who arrived just after the time of distribution were often forty eight hours without food. the latter might also be six days without meat.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0324.wav|or the keeper made them a special grant of six pence per diem out of the common stock;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0325.wav|or the sixpenny allowance was claimed for the creditors, which seldom happened, owing to the expense the process entailed.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0327.wav|or from persons who made a trade of it, or they might bring their beds with them into the prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ002-0328.wav|failing any of these methods, seeing that straw was forbidden for fear of fire, they had to be satisfied with a couple of the rugs provided by the city

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0253.wav|clothes or prison uniform would not have served the purpose, for a disguise can be rapidly and secretly put on,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ003-0270.wav|owing to the facility of intercourse between inside and outside, many crimes were doubtless hatched in newgate.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0009.wav|as indefatigable and self sacrificing, found by personal visitation that the condition of jails throughout the kingdom was,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0010.wav|with a few bright exceptions, still deplorable and disgraceful.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0011.wav|mister neild was compelled to admit in eighteen twelve that "the great reformation produced by howard
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0012.wav|was in several places merely temporary:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0013.wav|some prisons that had been ameliorated under the persuasive influence of his kind advice were relapsing into their former horrid state of privation,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0015.wav|the motives for a transient amendment were becoming paralyzed, and the effect had ceased with the cause."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0016.wav|i have shown in a previous chapter what newgate was at this period, despite a vast expenditure and boasted efforts to introduce reforms.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0017.wav|some of the county jails, and one or two borough jails, had been rebuilt,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0018.wav|generally through the personal activity of influential and benevolent local magnates, but the true principles of prison construction
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0019.wav|were as yet but imperfectly understood, and such portions of the "improved" jails of that period as were still extant a few years back,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0020.wav|contrast ludicrously with the prison architecture based upon a century's experience of our own age.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0021.wav|the neglect of prison reform in those days was not to be visited upon the legislature.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0022.wav|the executive, although harassed by internal commotion and foreign war, was not entirely callous to the crying need for amelioration in jails.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0023.wav|measures remedial, although at best partial and incomplete, were introduced from time to time.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0028.wav|various acts were also passed to consolidate and amend previous jail acts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0029.wav|the erection of new prison buildings was made imperative under certain conditions and following certain rules

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0031.wav|but the effect of this legislation was rather weakened by the remoteness of the pressure exercised.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0032.wav|the onus of improvement lay upon the magistracy, the local authorities administering local funds,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0034.wav|moreover, the laws applied more particularly to county jurisdictions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0035.wav|the borough jails, those in fact under corporate management, were not included in the new measures;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0036.wav|it was hoped that their rulers would hire accommodation in the county prisons, and that the inferior establishments would in course of time disappear.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0062.wav|and the reason is plain: you have taken him from his home, and have deprived him of the means of providing himself with the necessaries or comforts of life,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0085.wav|as far back as the reign of charles the second, a law was passed declaring that sufficient provision should be made for the relief and setting on work

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0088.wav|as a remedy, justices of the peace were empowered to provide materials for the setting of poor prisoners to work,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0089.wav|and to pay overseers or instructors out of the county rates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0090.wav|again, the twenty two charles the second c twenty ordered the jailer to keep felons and debtors "separate and apart from one another,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0130.wav|incommodious, as has been stated, insecure, unhealthy, and unprovided with the printed or written regulations required by law.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0137.wav|and that it was accomplished by "sleeping edgewise."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0138.wav|one poor wretch, who had slept next the wall, said he had been literally unable to move for the pressure.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0146.wav|there was no infirmary, no chapel, no work, no classification.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0147.wav|the irons, which nearly every one wore, were remarkably heavy; those double ironed could not take off their small clothes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0148.wav|no prison dress was allowed, and half the inmates were without shirts or shoes or stockings.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0149.wav|the diet was limited to dry bread, which was of the best certainly, and a pound and a half in weight.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0150.wav|matters were on much the same footing at saint albans.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0151.wav|they were far worse at bristol,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0152.wav|although at mister buxton's visit a new jail was in process of erection, the first step towards reform since howard's visitation in seventeen seventy four.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0153.wav|in eighteen eighteen the old jail was so densely packed that it was nearly impossible to pass through the yards for the throng.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0157.wav|all charged with felony were in heavy irons, without distinction of age.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0158.wav|all were in ill health; almost all were in rags; almost all were filthy in the extreme.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0161.wav|"the indescribable stench," presented together a concentration of the utmost misery and the utmost guilt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0162.wav|it was "a scene of infernal passions and distresses," says buxton, "which few have imagination sufficient to picture,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0163.wav|and of which fewer still would believe that the original is to be found in this enlightened and happy country."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0164.wav|there was still worse to come. having explored the yards and adjacent day rooms, and sleeping cells, a door was unlocked,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0165.wav|the visitors were furnished with candles, and they descended eighteen long steps into a vault.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0166.wav|at the bottom was a circular space, through which ran a narrow passage, and the sides of which were fitted with barrack bedsteads.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0167.wav|the floor was on the level of the river, and very damp.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0168.wav|the smell at one o'clock of the day "was something more than can be expressed by the term disgusting."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0169.wav|on the dirty bedstead lay a wretched being in the throes of severe illness.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0170.wav|the only ventilation of this pit, this "dark, cheerless, damp, unwholesome cavern a dungeon in its worst sense"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0171.wav|was by a kind of chimney, which the prisoners kept hermetically sealed, and which had never been opened in the memory of the turnkey.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0172.wav|untried persons were often lodged in this nauseous underground den,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0173.wav|and sometimes slept in "the pit," loaded with heavy irons for a whole year, waiting the jail delivery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0174.wav|confinement for twelve months in the bristol jail was counted a punishment equivalent to seven years' transportation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0175.wav|in this prison there was no female infirmary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0176.wav|sick women and their children remained in the ordinary wards, and propagated disease.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0177.wav|no prison dress was allowed; no reception room was provided, no soap, towels, or baths.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0178.wav|the bedclothes consisted only of a single "very slight" rug.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0179.wav|the allowance of food daily to felons was a fourpenny loaf,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0180.wav|a price which in those days fluctuated enormously as much as a hundred percent in a couple of years;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0181.wav|but as no similar variation occurred in the prisoner's appetite, his ration was somewhat precarious.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0182.wav|as for the debtors, they had no allowance whatever, and were often in imminent danger of starvation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0183.wav|with all this, the inmates were crowded together at night to such a degree as to excite surprise that they should escape suffocation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0184.wav|there reigned through the whole edifice a chilly, damp, unwholesome atmosphere, and the effluvia from the prisoners was so nauseous
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0185.wav|that the chaplain found it necessary to take his place before they entered chapel, as he could not otherwise have faced the smell.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0186.wav|it is consoling to know that there were a few brilliant exceptions to this cruel, callous neglect.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0187.wav|already, as early as eighteen eighteen, a prison existed at bury saint edmunds which was a model for imitation to others at that time,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0188.wav|and which even fulfilled many of the exacting requirements of modern days.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0189.wav|the great principles of classification, cleanliness, and employment were closely observed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0190.wav|there were eighty four separate sleeping cells, and unless the jail was overcrowded, every inmate passed the night alone,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0191.wav|and in comparative comfort, with a bed and proper bedding.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0192.wav|the prison stood on a dry, airy situation outside the town.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0193.wav|prisoners on reception were treated as they are now a days bathed, dressed in prison clothes, and inspected by the surgeon.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0194.wav|no irons were worn except as a punishment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0195.wav|personal cleanliness was insisted upon, and all parts of the prison were kept scrupulously clean.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0196.wav|there was an infirmary, properly found and duly looked after.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0197.wav|no idleness was permitted among the inmates. trades were taught, or prisoners were allowed to follow their own if suitable.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0198.wav|there was, besides, a mill for grinding corn, somewhat similar to a turn spit, which prisoners turned by walking in rows.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0199.wav|this made exertion compulsory, and imposed hard labor as a proper punishment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0200.wav|another jail, that of ilchester, was also worthy of all commendation. it exhibited all the good points of that at bury.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0201.wav|at ilchester the rule of employment had been carried further.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0202.wav|a system not adopted generally till nearly half a century later had already prevailed at ilchester.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0203.wav|the new jail had been in a great measure constructed by the prisoners themselves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0204.wav|masons, bricklayers, carpenters, painters had been employed upon the buildings, and the work was pronounced excellent by competent judges.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0205.wav|industrial labor had also been introduced with satisfactory results.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0206.wav|blanket weaving and cloth spinning was carried on prosperously,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0207.wav|and all the material for prisoners' apparel was manufactured in the jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0208.wav|there were work rooms for wool washing, dyeing, carding, and spinning.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0209.wav|the looms were constantly busy. tailors were always at work, and every article of clothing and bedding was made up within the walls.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0210.wav|there was a prison laundry too, where all the prisoners' linen was regularly washed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0211.wav|the moral welfare of the inmates was as closely looked after as the physical.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0212.wav|there was an attentive chaplain, a schoolmaster, and regular religious and other instruction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0213.wav|compared with those highly meritorious institutions newgate still showed but badly.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0214.wav|its evils were inherent and irremediable, but some ameliorating measures had been introduced,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0215.wav|mainly through the exertions of a new governor, mister brown, who succeeded mister newman at newgate in eighteen seventeen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0216.wav|the most noticeable of the improvements introduced was a better regulation of dietaries within the prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0217.wav|the old haphazard system, by which meat was issued in bulk,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0218.wav|a week's allowance at a time, was abolished, and there was a regular scale of daily rations adopted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0219.wav|the diet was now ample. it consisted of a pound and a half of bread per diem;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0220.wav|for breakfast a pint of gruel; for dinner half a pound of boiled meat, or a quart of soup with vegetables, on alternate days.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0221.wav|the food was properly prepared in the prison kitchen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0222.wav|meat was no longer issued raw, to be imperfectly cooked before a ward fire and bolted gluttonously, the whole two pounds at one sitting.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0223.wav|mister brown confidently asserted that no jail in england now fed its inmates so well as did newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0224.wav|so plentiful was this dietary, that although the old permission remained in force of allowing the friends of prisoners to bring them supplies from outside,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0225.wav|the practice was falling into abeyance, and the prisoners seldom required private assistance to eke out their meals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0226.wav|it was also claimed for the more ample and more orderly distribution of victuals, that the general health of the prisoners had greatly improved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0227.wav|mister brown also, much to his own credit, brought about the abandonment of the practice of ironing all prisoners as a matter of course.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0228.wav|in eighteen eighteen prisoners awaiting trial in newgate, were at length relieved from this illegal infliction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0229.wav|convicts were not even compelled to wear irons, providing they behaved well.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0230.wav|it was found that shackles might be safely dispensed with, even in the case of the most desperate characters.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0231.wav|this was effected by stopping the nearly indiscriminate admission of visitors, which had hitherto prevailed all over the jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0232.wav|ironing it will be remembered, was a distinguishing badge, so that when the jail was cleared the free might be readily known from the captive, and escapes prevented.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ004-0233.wav|under the new rule visitors were not allowed to pass into the interior of the prison, but were detained between the grating.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0041.wav|a much needed and, according to our ideas, indispensable reform, already initiated by the ladies' committee at newgate.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0046.wav|the good it tried to do took active shape in the establishment of temporary refuges at hoxton for males, and in the hackney road for females

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0056.wav|it is interesting to observe that the plan of "radiation," by which the prison blocks radiated from a central hall, like spokes in a wheel

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0061.wav|but it offered suggestions for future buildings, with numerous carefully executed drawings and designs of the model it recommended for imitation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0062.wav|experience has since shown that in some respects these plans are defective, especially in the placing of the governor's residence in the center of the prison.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0263.wav|and not, as heretofore, to the judges of assize; that, both to check abuses and watch the progress of improvement,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0264.wav|inspectors of prisons should be appointed, who should visit all the prisons from time to time and report to the secretary of state.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0265.wav|it was recommended that the dietaries should be submitted and approved like the rules; that convicted prisoners should not receive any food but the jail allowance;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0268.wav|should be strictly prohibited, "as a stimulating luxury inconsistent with any notion of strict discipline and the due pressure of just punishment."

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0270.wav|which should be paid into general prison funds, and no part of them handed over to the prisoners themselves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0271.wav|as a means of increasing the severity of imprisonment, letters and visits from outside should not be permitted during the first six months of an imprisonment.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ005-0274.wav|the committee most of all insisted upon the entire individual separation of prisoners, except during the hours of labor,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0010.wav|mister samuel hoare, when examined, considered it indispensably necessary, to carry out whatever system might be established,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0013.wav|sir frederick roe was of the same opinion as regards the appointment, but he would give the inspectors the power of acting as well as reporting.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0039.wav|and limited it to newgate alone. newgate indeed became the sole theme of their first report.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0040.wav|the fact was that the years as they passed, nearly twenty in all, had worked but little permanent improvement in this detestable prison.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0042.wav|relapse was rapid and inevitable, so that the latter state of the prison was worse than the first.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0043.wav|the disgraceful overcrowding had been partially ended, but the same evils of indiscriminate association were still present; there was the old neglect of decency,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0046.wav|there was no longer the faintest possible excuse for overcrowding. the numbers now committed to newgate had sensibly diminished.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0047.wav|the prison had become more or less a place of detention only, harboring mainly those awaiting trial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0048.wav|to these were still added an average of about fifty expecting the last penalty of the law; a certain number of transports awaiting removal to the colonies;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0050.wav|the exchequer, the commissioners of bankruptcy and of taxes; smugglers, and a larger number sentenced for very short terms,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0051.wav|and for offenses of the most varying description, by the central criminal court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0052.wav|the sum total thus produced was inconsiderable compared with the hundreds that had formerly filled the jail,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0054.wav|but incredible as it may appear, the authorities of newgate declined to avail themselves of the advantages offered them,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0055.wav|and when the population fell they shut up one half the jail and crowded up the other.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0056.wav|some rooms remained quite empty and unoccupied, while others were full to overflowing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0057.wav|not only were the wards thus needlessly crammed, and for no reason but the niggardliness of the corporation which refused a proper supply of bedding
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0058.wav|but the occupants of each were huddled together indiscriminately. the inspectors found in the same wards in the chapel yard the convicted and the untried,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0062.wav|in another part there were men charged with and convicted of unnatural offenses shut up with lads of tender years;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0063.wav|minor offenders charged with small thefts or non payment of small sums were cheek by jowl with convicts sentenced to long terms of transportation.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0066.wav|in the middle yard it was still worse.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0157.wav|this was only one of many grave omissions on his part. he did not feel it incumbent on himself to visit his prison often or see his prisoners.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0160.wav|one man who had been in the condemned ward for two months, said the governor only came there four times.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0162.wav|but it is only fair to mister cope to state that he himself said he went whenever he could find time

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0164.wav|but when he did visit, his inspections were of the most superficial character
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0165.wav|sometimes he looked at his bolts and bars, but he never examined the cupboards, coal boxes, or other possible hiding places for cards

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0169.wav|he really did not know what passed in his jail
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0170.wav|and was surprised when the inspectors proved to him that practices of which he was ignorant, and which he admitted that he reprehended, went on without hindrance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0171.wav|he was satisfied to let matters run on as in the old times, he said in his own justification; with him what was, was right,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0173.wav|he kept no daily journal of occurrences, and nothing, however important, was recorded at the time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0174.wav|the aldermen never called upon him to report, and left him nearly unsupervised and uncontrolled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0175.wav|in his administration of discipline he was quite uncertain;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0176.wav|the punishments he inflicted were unequal,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0177.wav|and it was not the least part of the blame imputed to him that he made special favorites of particular prisoners, retaining of his own accord in newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0178.wav|and for years, felons who should have been sent beyond the seas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0179.wav|but, indeed, his whole rule was far too mild, and under this mistaken leniency
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0180.wav|the interior of the jail was more like a bear garden or the noisy purlieus of a public house than a prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0181.wav|it was the same old story evil constantly in the ascendant, the least criminal at the mercy of the most depraved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0182.wav|under the reckless contempt for regulations,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0183.wav|the apathy of the authorities, and the undue ascendancy of those who, as convicted felons, should have been most sternly repressed,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0189.wav|gambling, indirect contravention of parliamentary rules, instruction in all nefarious processes,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0195.wav|this was admitted in evidence by the turnkeys, and was proved by the appearance of the prison tables, which bore the marks of gaming boards deeply cut into them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0196.wav|prisoners confessed that it was a favorite occupation, the chief games being "shoving halfpence" on the table,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0197.wav|pitch in the hole, cribbage, dominoes, and common tossing, at which as much as four or five shillings would change hands in an hour.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0198.wav|but this was not the only amusement. most of the wards took in the daily papers,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0199.wav|the most popular being the "times," "morning herald," and "morning chronicle"; on sunday the "weekly dispatch," "bell's life," and the "weekly messenger."

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0201.wav|went at once to his customers, who bought their paper and paid for it themselves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0202.wav|the news vendor was also a tobacconist,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0203.wav|and he had thus ample means of introducing to the prisoners the prohibited but always much coveted and generally procurable weed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0204.wav|in the same way the wardsman laid in his stock to be retailed. other light literature besides the daily journals were in circulation:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ006-0205.wav|novels, flash songs, play books, such as "jane shore," "grimm's german tales," with cruikshank's illustrations,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0004.wav|although their ministrations were occasionally extended to the male side.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0005.wav|the inspectors paid tribute to the excellence of the motives of these philanthropic ladies, and recognized the good they did.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0007.wav|had provided work for those who had hitherto passed their time in total idleness, and had made the treatment of female transports on the way to new south wales

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0009.wav|they had tried, moreover,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0010.wav|by their presence and their pious, disinterested efforts, to restrain the dissolute manners and vicious language of the unhappy and depraved inmates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0011.wav|but it was already plain that they constituted an independent authority within the jails; they were frequently in conflict with the chaplain,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0013.wav|that women should be frequently kept from chapel in order that they might attend the ladies' lectures and exhortations.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0016.wav|it tended to "dissipate reflection, diminish the gloom of the prison, and mitigate the punishment which the law has sentenced the prisoner to undergo."

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0124.wav|the infirmary at this particular period epitomized the condition of the jail at large.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0125.wav|it was diverted from its proper uses, and, as the "place of the greatest comfort," was allotted to persons who should not have been sent to newgate at all.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0126.wav|all the evils of indiscriminate association were strongly accentuated by the crowd collected within its narrow limits.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0137.wav|more attention to ventilation, which was altogether neglected and inadequate, would have secured a better atmosphere for the unhappy inmates

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0139.wav|again, the discipline commonly deemed inseparable from every place of durance was entirely wanting.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0140.wav|the primary object of committing a prisoner to jail, as the inspectors pointed out, was to deter not only the criminal himself, but others from crime,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0151.wav|and his connection with them is confirmed by that devotion and generosity towards their paramours in adversity for which these otherwise degraded women are remarkable.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0194.wav|the fixing of "inspection holes" in the doors and walls, so as to insure more supervision; of windows opening into the well holes,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0195.wav|to give better light and ventilation; the construction of bed places, three tiers high alongside the walls for males, two tiers for females;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0197.wav|the infirmary was enlarged, the admission of visitors limited, and the passing of articles prevented by a wire screen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0198.wav|the windows were to be glazed and painted to prevent prisoners from looking out;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0199.wav|baths, fumigating places for clothing, wash house, and the removal of dust bins, completed the new arrangements in the main prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0200.wav|in the press yard, the press room and ward above it were parceled out into nine separate sleeping cells;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0201.wav|each was provided with an iron bedstead, and a small desk at which the condemned man might read or write.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0206.wav|in endeavoring to arrest contamination, prisoners were more closely confined, and associated in smaller numbers;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0207.wav|but this had the effect of throwing them into closer contact, and of making them more intimately acquainted with, more directly influential upon, one another.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0232.wav|the plan adopted for ventilating the dining room on the 'master's side' and that of the middle yard is very inefficient;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0237.wav|many rats also come through these so called ventilators, as they open close to the ground at the back of the prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ007-0238.wav|at the same time the inspectors animadvert strongly upon the misconduct of prisoners and the frequency of prison punishments,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0003.wav|which we left at the time of the discontinuance of the long practiced procession to tyburn.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0004.wav|the reasons for this change were fully set forth in a previous chapter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0005.wav|the terrible spectacle was as demoralizing to the public, for whose admonition it was intended,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0006.wav|as the exposure was brutal and cruel towards the principal actors.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0007.wav|the decision to remove the scene of action to the immediate front of the jail itself
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0008.wav|was in the right direction, as making the performance shorter and diminishing the area of display.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0009.wav|but the old bailey was not exclusively used;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0010.wav|at first, and for some few years after seventeen eighty four, executions took place occasionally at a distance from newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0011.wav|this was partly due to the survival of the old notion that the scene of the crime ought also to witness the retribution;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0012.wav|partly perhaps because residents in and about the old bailey raised a loud protest against the constant erection of the scaffold in their neighborhood.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0013.wav|as regards the first, i find that in seventeen eighty six
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0014.wav|john hogan, the murderer of a mister odell, an attorney who resided in charlotte street, rathbone place,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0015.wav|was executed on a gibbet in front of his victim's house.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0016.wav|lawrence jones, a burglar, was in seventeen ninety three ordered for execution in hatton garden, near the house he had robbed;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0017.wav|and when he evaded the sentence by suicide, his body was exhibited in the same neighborhood,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0018.wav|extended upon a plank on the top of an open cart, in his clothes, and fettered.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0019.wav|again, as late as eighteen oh nine and eighteen twelve, execution dock, on the banks of the thames, was still retained.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0023.wav|two sailors, charles palm and sam tilling, were hanged at the same place for the murder of their captain, james keith

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0025.wav|they were taken in a cart to the place of execution, amidst a vast concourse of people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0026.wav|palm, as soon as he was seated in the cart,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0027.wav|put a quid of tobacco into his mouth, and offered another to his companion, who refused it with indignation
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0028.wav|some indications of pity were offered for the fate of tilling; palm, execration alone.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0029.wav|but the old bailey gradually, and in spite of all objections urged, monopolized the dread business of execution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0030.wav|the first affair of the kind on this spot was on the third december, seventeen eighty three,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0031.wav|when, in pursuance of an order issued by the recorder to the sheriffs of middlesex and the keeper of his majesty's jail, newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0032.wav|a scaffold was erected in front of that prison for the execution of several convicts named by the recorder.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0033.wav|ten were executed
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0034.wav|the scaffold hung with black; and the inhabitants of the neighborhood, having petitioned the sheriffs to remove the scene of execution to the old place,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0035.wav|were told that the plan had been well considered, and would be persevered in.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0036.wav|the following twenty third april, it is stated that the malefactors ordered for execution on the eighteenth instead
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0037.wav|were brought out of newgate about eight in the morning, and suspended on a gallows of a new construction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0038.wav|after hanging the usual time they were taken down, and the machine cleared away in half an hour.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0039.wav|by practice the art is much improved, and there is no part of the world in which villains are hanged in so neat a manner, and with so little ceremony.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0040.wav|a full description of this new gallows, which was erected in front of the debtors' door, is to be found in contemporary records.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0041.wav|the criminals are not exposed to view till they mount the fatal stage. the last part of the stage, or that next to the jail,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0042.wav|is enclosed by a temporary roof, under which are placed two seats for the reception of the sheriffs, one on each side of the stairs leading to the scaffold.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0043.wav|round the north, west, and south sides are erected galleries for the reception of officers, attendants, etc.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0044.wav|and at the distance of five feet from the same is fixed a strong railing all round the scaffold to enclose a place for the constables.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0045.wav|in the middle of this machinery is placed a movable platform, in form of a trap door, ten feet long by eight wide,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0046.wav|on the middle of which is placed the gibbet, extending from the jail across the old bailey.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0047.wav|this movable platform is raised six inches higher than the rest of the scaffold, and on it the convicts stand;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0048.wav|it is supported by two beams, which are held in their place by bolts. the movement of the lever withdraws the bolts, the platform falls in;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0049.wav|and this, being much more sudden and regular than that of a cart being drawn away, has the effect of immediate death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0050.wav|a broadsheet dated april twenty fourth, seventeen eighty seven, describing an execution on the newly invented scaffold before the debtors' door,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0051.wav|says, "the scaffold on which these miserable people suffered is a temporary machine which was drawn out of the yard of the sessions house by horses;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0052.wav|it is supported by strong posts fixed into grooves made in the street;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0053.wav|the whole is temporary, being all calculated to take to pieces, which are preserved within the prison."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0054.wav|this contrivance appears to have been copied with improvements from that which had been used in dublin at a still earlier date,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0055.wav|for that city claims the priority in establishing the custom of hanging criminals at the jail itself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0056.wav|the dublin "engine of death," as the gallows are styled in the account from which the following description is taken, consisted of an iron bar
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0057.wav|parallel to the prison wall, and about four feet from it, but strongly affixed thereto with iron scroll clamps.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0058.wav|from this bar hang several iron loops, in which the halters are tied.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0059.wav|under this bar at a proper distance is a piece of flooring or platform,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0060.wav|projecting somewhat beyond the range of the iron bar, and swinging upon hinges affixed to the wall.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0061.wav|the entrance upon this floor or leaf is from the middle window over the gate of the prison;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0062.wav|and this floor is supported below,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0063.wav|while the criminals stand upon it, by two pieces of timber, which are made to slide in and out of the prison wall through apertures made for that purpose.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0064.wav|when the criminals are tied up and prepared for their fate, this floor suddenly falls down, upon withdrawing the supporters inwards.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0065.wav|they are both drawn at once by a windlass, and the unhappy culprits remain suspended.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0066.wav|this mode of execution, it is alleged, gave rise to the old vulgar "chaff," "take care, or you'll die at the fall of the leaf."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0067.wav|the machinery in use in dublin is much the same as that employed at many jails now a days.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0068.wav|but the fall apart and inwards of two leaves is considered superior.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0069.wav|the latter is the method still followed at newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0070.wav|the sentences inflicted in front of newgate were not limited to hanging.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0071.wav|in the few years which elapsed between the establishment of the gallows at newgate
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0072.wav|and the abolition of the practice of burning females for petty treason, more than one woman suffered this penalty at the old bailey.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0078.wav|seemed to strike her mind with horror and consternation, to the exclusion of all power of recollectedness in preparation for the approaching awful moment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0079.wav|she walked from the debtors' door to a stake fixed in the ground about half way between the scaffold and newgate street.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0080.wav|she was immediately tied by the neck to an iron bolt fixed near the top of the stake,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0081.wav|and after praying fervently for a few minutes, the steps on which she stood were drawn away, and she was left suspended.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0082.wav|a chain fastened by nails to the stake was then put round her body by the executioner with his assistants.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0083.wav|two cart loads of faggots were piled about her, and after she had hung for half an hour the fire was kindled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0084.wav|the flames presently burned the halter, the body fell a few inches, and hung then by the iron chain.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0085.wav|the fire had not quite burnt out at twelve, in nearly four hours, that is to say.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0227.wav|slipshod and slovenly, in crushed bonnet and dirty shawl, the gown fastened by a single hook,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0228.wav|their harsh and half cracked voices full of maudlin, besotted sympathy for those about to die.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0231.wav|hush! the unceasing murmur of the mob now breaks into a loud deep roar,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0232.wav|a sound as if the ocean had suddenly broken through some ancient boundary, against which its ever restless billows had for ages battered;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0233.wav|the wide dark sea of heads is all at once in motion;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0234.wav|each wave seems trying to overleap the other as they are drawn onwards towards this outlet.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0237.wav|the human hand that placed it there was only seen for a moment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0238.wav|as it lay, white and ghastly, upon the black boards, and then again was as suddenly withdrawn, as if ashamed of the deed it had done.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0239.wav|the loud shout of the multitude once more subsided, or only fell upon the abstracted ear like the dreamy murmur of an ocean shell.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0241.wav|were vended under the names of notorious murderers, highwaymen, and criminals,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0242.wav|famous in the annals of newgate for the hardihood they had displayed in the hour of execution, when they terminated their career of crime at the gallows.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0243.wav|threading his way among these itinerant vendors was seen the meek faced deliverer of tracts, the man of good intentions, now bonneted,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0244.wav|now laughed at, the skirt of his seedy black coat torn across; yet,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0245.wav|though pulled right and left, or sent headlong into the crowd by the swing of some brutal and muscular arm,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0246.wav|never once from that pale face passed away its benign and patient expression.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0247.wav|but ever the same form moved along in the fulfillment of his mission, in spite of all persecution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0248.wav|another fight followed the score which had already taken place; this time two women were the combatants.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0249.wav|blinded with their long hair, they tore at each other like two furies; their bonnets and caps were trodden underfoot in the kennel,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0250.wav|and lay disregarded beside the body of the poor dog which, while searching for its master in the crowd,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0251.wav|was an hour before kicked to death by the savage and brutal mob.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0252.wav|another deep roar, louder than any which had preceded it, broke from the multitude.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0253.wav|then came the cry of 'hats off!' and 'down in front!' as at a theatre.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0254.wav|it was followed by the deep and solemn booming of the death bell from the church of saint sepulchre
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0255.wav|the iron knell that rang upon the beating heart of the living man who was about to die;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0256.wav|and with blanched cheek, and sinking, we turned away from the scene.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0257.wav|in thus describing the saturnalia before the gallows i have been drawn on somewhat beyond the period with which i am at present dealing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0258.wav|let me retrace my steps, and speak more in detail of the treatment of the condemned in those bloodthirsty and brutally indifferent days,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0259.wav|and of their demeanor after sentence until the last penalty was paid.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0260.wav|one of the worst evils was the terrible and long protracted uncertainty as to the result.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0261.wav|in the case of convicted murderers only was prompt punishment inflicted,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0262.wav|and with them indeed this dispatch amounted to undue precipitancy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0263.wav|forty eight hours was the limit of time allowed to the unhappy man to make his peace, and during that time he was still kept on a bare allowance of bread and water.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0264.wav|but the murderers formed only a small proportion of the total number sentenced to death, and for the rest there was a long period of anxious suspense,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0265.wav|although in the long run mercy generally prevailed, and very few capitally convicted for crimes less than murder actually suffered.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0266.wav|thus in the years between may first, eighteen twenty seven, and thirtieth april, eighteen thirty one,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0267.wav|no less than four hundred and fifty one sentences of death for capital crimes were passed at the old bailey;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0268.wav|but of these three hundred and ninety six were reversed by the king in council, and only fifty two were really executed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0269.wav|already the severity of our criminal code, and the number of capital felonies upon the statute book, had brought a reaction;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0270.wav|and while the courts adhered to the letter of the law, appeals were constantly made to the royal prerogative of mercy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0271.wav|this was more particularly the practice in london.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0272.wav|judges on assize were satisfied with simply recording a sentence of death against offenders whom they did not think deserved the extreme penalty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0273.wav|at the old bailey almost every one capitally convicted by a jury was sentenced to be hanged.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0274.wav|the result in the latter case was left in the first place to the king in council,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0275.wav|but there was a further appeal then, as now, to the king himself, or practically to the home secretary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0276.wav|neither in town or country were cases entirely taken on their own merits.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0277.wav|convicted offenders might have good or bad luck; they might be arraigned when their particular crime was uncommon, and were then nearly certain to escape;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0278.wav|or theirs might be one of many, and it might be considered necessary to "make an example."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0279.wav|in this latter it might fairly be said that a man was put to death less for his own sins than for the crimes of others.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0280.wav|the absurdity of the system, its irregularity and cruelty, were fully touched upon by the inspectors of prisons in their first report.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0281.wav|they found at newgate, under disgraceful conditions as already described,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0282.wav|seventeen capital convicts, upon all of whom the sentence of death had been passed. eventually two only of the whole number suffered;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0283.wav|two others were sentenced to three months' imprisonment, and the balance to varying terms.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0284.wav|nothing could be more strongly marked than the contrast between the ultimate destiny of different individuals all abiding the same awful doom:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0285.wav|on the one hand the gallows, on the other a short imprisonment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0286.wav|the inspectors very properly desired to call attention to the inevitable tendency in this mode of dealing with "the most awful sanctions of the law,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0287.wav|to make those sanctions an object of contemptuous mockery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0288.wav|the consequences were plainly proved to the inspectors.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0289.wav|capitally convicted prisoners did, as a matter of fact, "treat with habitual and inexpressible levity the sentence of death."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0290.wav|of this i have treated at length in the last chapter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0291.wav|the time thus spent varied considerably,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0292.wav|but it was seldom less than six weeks. it all depended upon the sovereign's disposition to do business.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0293.wav|sometimes the privy council did not meet for months, and during all that time the convicts languished with hope
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0294.wav|nearly indefinitely deferred.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0295.wav|when the council had decided, the news was conveyed to newgate by the recorder, who made his "report," as it was called.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0296.wav|the time of the arrival of this report was generally known at newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0297.wav|and its contents were anxiously awaited by both convicts in the press yard and their friends collected in a crowd outside the gates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0298.wav|sometimes the report was delayed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0299.wav|on one occasion, mister wakefield tells us, the recorder, who had attended the council at windsor, did not deliver the report till the following day.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0300.wav|the prisoners and their friends, therefore, were kept in a state of the most violent suspense for many hours,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0301.wav|during which they counted the moments the prisoners in their cells as usual, and their friends in the street in front of newgate, where they passed the night.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0302.wav|i have heard the protracted agony of both classes described by those who witnessed it in terms so strong, that i am unwilling to repeat them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0303.wav|the crowd of men and women who passed the night in front of newgate, began, as soon as the hour was passed when they had expected the report,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0304.wav|to utter imprecations against the recorder, the secretary of state, the council, and the king;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0305.wav|they never ceased cursing until the passion of anger so excited was exchanged for joy in some and grief in others.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0306.wav|i myself heard more than one of those whose lives were spared by that decision of the council,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0307.wav|afterwards express a wish to murder the recorder for having kept them so long in suspense.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0308.wav|the recorder's report generally reached newgate late at night.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0309.wav|its receipt was immediately followed by the promulgation of its contents to the persons most closely concerned,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0310.wav|which was done with a sort of ceremony intended to be impressive.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0311.wav|the whole of the convicts were assembled together in one ward, and made to kneel down.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0312.wav|to them entered the chaplain or ordinary of newgate in full canonicals,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0313.wav|who in solemn tones communicated to each in turn the fate in store for him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0314.wav|the form of imparting the intelligence was generally the same.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0315.wav|"so and so, i am sorry to tell you that it is all against you;" or,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0316.wav|"a. b., your case has been taken into consideration by the king in council, and his majesty has been mercifully pleased to spare your life."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0317.wav|the fatal news was not always received in the same way.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0318.wav|the men who were doomed often fell down in convulsions upon the floor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ008-0319.wav|sometimes any who had had a narrow escape fainted, but the bulk of those respited looked on with unfeeling indifference.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0002.wav|it is satisfactory to be able to record that some consideration was shown the capital convict actually awaiting execution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0003.wav|even so severe a critic as mister wakefield states that "a stranger to the scene
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0004.wav|would be astonished to observe the peculiar tenderness, i was going to add respect,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0005.wav|which persons under sentence of death obtain from all the officers of the prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0006.wav|before sentence a prisoner has only to observe the regulations of the jail in order to remain neglected and unnoticed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0007.wav|once ordered to the cells, friends of all classes suddenly rise up; his fellow prisoners, the turnkeys, the chaplain,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0008.wav|the keepers, and the sheriffs all seem interested in his fate, and he can make no reasonable request that is not at once granted by whomsoever he may address.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0009.wav|this rule has some, but very few, exceptions; such as where a hardened offender behaves with great levity and brutality, as if he cared nought for his life,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0010.wav|and thought every one anxious to promote his death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0011.wav|mister wakefield goes on to remark that persons convicted of forgery "excited an extraordinary degree of interest in all who approached them."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0012.wav|this was noticeable with fauntleroy, who, on account of his birth and antecedents, was allowed to occupy a turnkey's room,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0013.wav|and kept altogether separate from the other prisoners until the day of his death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0014.wav|it cannot be denied, however, that the ordinary's treatment was somewhat unfeeling, and in proof thereof
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0015.wav|i will quote an extract from the reverend gentleman's own journal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0016.wav|he seems to have improved the occasion when preaching the condemned sermon before fauntleroy, by pointing a moral from that unhappy man's own case.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0017.wav|for this the chaplain was a few days later summoned before the jail committee of aldermen,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0018.wav|and informed that the public would not in future be admitted to hear the condemned sermon. "i was also informed," writes mister cotton,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0019.wav|that this resolution was in consequence of their (the aldermen's) disapproving of the last discourse delivered by me,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0020.wav|previous to the execution of henry fauntleroy for uttering a forged security
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0021.wav|in which it was said i had enlarged upon the heinous nature of his crime, and warned the public to avoid such conduct.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0022.wav|i was informed that this unnecessarily harassed his feelings, and that the object of such sermons was solely to console the prisoner,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0023.wav|and that from the time of his conviction nothing but what is consolatory should be addressed to a criminal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0024.wav|one of the aldermen, moreover, informed me that the whole court of aldermen were unanimous in their opinion on this subject.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0025.wav|as to the exclusion of strangers on these occasions,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0026.wav|the experience i have had convinces me that one, and perhaps the only, good of an execution, i. e. the solemn admonition to the public,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0027.wav|will thereby be lost.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0028.wav|probably the reader will side with the aldermen against the ordinary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0029.wav|this episode throws some doubt upon the tenderness and proper feeling exhibited by the chaplain towards the most deserving members of his criminal flock;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0030.wav|and the idea will be strengthened by the following account of the sunday service in the prison chapel on the occasion when the condemned sermon was preached.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0031.wav|the extract is from mister e. gibbon wakefield's brochure, the date eighteen twenty eight, just three years after fauntleroy's death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0032.wav|strangers were now excluded, but the sheriffs attended in state, wearing their gold chains,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0033.wav|while behind their pew stood a couple of tall footmen in state liveries.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0034.wav|the sheriffs were in one gallery;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0035.wav|in the other opposite were the convicts capitally convicted who had been respited.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0036.wav|down below between the galleries was the mass of the prison population;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0037.wav|the schoolmaster and the juvenile prisoners being seated round the communion table, opposite the pulpit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0038.wav|in the center of the chapel was the condemned pew, a large dock like erection painted black.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0039.wav|those who sat in it were visible to the whole congregation, and still more to the ordinary,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0040.wav|whose desk and pulpit were just in front of the condemned pew, and within a couple of yards of it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0041.wav|the occupants of this terrible black pew were the last always to enter the chapel.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ009-0042.wav|upon the occasion which i am describing they were four in number; and here i will continue the narrative in mister wakefield's own words:

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0303.wav|according to fauntleroy's own case, he found at once that the firm was heavily involved,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0304.wav|through advances made to various builders, and that it could only maintain its credit by wholesale discounting.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0305.wav|its embarrassments were greatly increased by the bankruptcy of two of its clients in the building trade,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ010-0306.wav|and the bank became liable for a sum of one hundred seventy thousand pounds.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0005.wav|a lady in the country, who had thirteen thousand pounds in the stocks, desired her london agent to sell them out.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0007.wav|and was told by mister fauntleroy that the lady had desired him to sell out, "which i have done," added the fraudulent banker, "and here are the proceeds,"

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0025.wav|and it was openly stated in the press and in conversation that the proceeds of these frauds had been squandered in chambering, gambling, and debauchery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0026.wav|fauntleroy was scouted as a licentious libertine, a deep and determined gamester, a spendthrift whose extravagance knew no bounds.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0031.wav|he called many witnesses, seventeen in all, to speak of him as they had found him; and these, all respectable city merchants and business men,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0032.wav|declared that they had hitherto formed a high opinion of his honor, integrity, and goodness of disposition,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0033.wav|deeming him the last person capable of a dishonorable action.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0034.wav|these arguments availed little with the jury, who after a short deliberation found fauntleroy guilty, and he was sentenced to death.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0037.wav|appeals were made to the home secretary, and all possible political interest brought to bear, but without success.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0042.wav|visited mister fauntleroy. the sheriffs have very kindly permitted him to remain in the turnkey's room where he was originally placed; nor can i omit expressing a hope
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0043.wav|that this may prove the beginning of a better system of confinement, and that every description of persons who may be unfortunately under sentence of death

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0045.wav|the kindliness of the city authorities to fauntleroy was not limited to the assignment of a separate place of durance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0046.wav|as i have already said, they took the chaplain seriously to task for the bad taste shown in the condemned sermon preached before fauntleroy.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0048.wav|wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth take heed lest he fall," and was full of the most pointed allusions to the culprit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0049.wav|fauntleroy constantly groaned aloud while the sermon proceeded, and contemporary reports declared
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0050.wav|that he appeared to feel deeply the force of the reverend gentleman's observations, especially when the chaplain spoke of
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0051.wav|the great magnitude of our erring brother's offense, one of the most dangerous description in a trading community.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0052.wav|the sermon ended with an appeal to the dying man, exhorting him to penitence.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0056.wav|angelini wrote to the lord mayor to this effect,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0057.wav|urging that fauntleroy was a father, a citizen: "his life is useful, mine a burthen, to the state."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0058.wav|he was summoned to the mansion house, where he repeated his request, crying, "accordez moi cette grace," with much urgency.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0059.wav|there were doubts of his sanity.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0060.wav|he wrote afterwards to the effect that the moment he had offered himself, an unknown assassin came to aim a blow at him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0061.wav|let this monster give his name; i am ready to fight him. i am still determined to put myself in the place of mister fauntleroy.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0068.wav|it was said that strangulation had been prevented by the insertion of a silver tube in his wind pipe,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0069.wav|and that after hanging for the regulated time he was taken down and easily restored to consciousness.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0077.wav|the act for which he was taken into custody was the payment of a forged ten pound note for half a dozen silver spoons.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0079.wav|he soon left the service and betook himself to dishonest ways.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0080.wav|his first forgery was the marvelous imitation of the signature of the honorable mister neville, m.p., who wrote an extremely cramped and curious hand.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0081.wav|he was not prosecuted for this fraud on account of the respectability of his family, and soon after this escape
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0082.wav|he came to london, where he practiced as a professional swindler and cheat.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0083.wav|for a long time justice did not overtake him for any criminal offense, but he was frequently in newgate and in the king's bench for debt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0084.wav|after three years' confinement in the latter prison he passed himself off as his brother, colonel montgomery,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0149.wav|the abduction of miss turner by the brothers wakefield bore a strong resemblance to the carrying off and forcible marrying of heiresses as already described.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0156.wav|while on a visit to macclesfield he heard by chance of miss turner, and that she would inherit all her father's possessions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0157.wav|he thereupon conceived an idea of carrying her off and marrying her willy nilly at gretna green.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0163.wav|she was not in immediate danger, but she wished to see her daughter, "as it was possible she might soon become incapable of recognizing any one."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0164.wav|miss turner, greatly agitated, accompanied the messenger who had brought this news, a disguised servant of wakefield's,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0165.wav|who had plausibly explained that he had only recently been engaged at shrigley.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0166.wav|the road taken was via manchester, where the servant said a doctor hull was to be picked up to go on with them to shrigley.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0168.wav|miss turner was shown into a private room, where mister wakefield soon presented himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0169.wav|miss turner, not knowing him, would have left the room, but he said he came from her father, and she remained.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0170.wav|wakefield, in reply to her inquiries, satisfied her that her mother was well, and that the real reason for summoning her from school
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0171.wav|was the state of her father's affairs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0172.wav|mister turner was on the verge of bankruptcy. he was at that moment at kendal, and wished her to join him there at once.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0174.wav|but at kendal there was no mister turner, and, to allay miss turner's growing anxiety,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0175.wav|wakefield found it necessary to become more explicit regarding her father's affairs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0176.wav|he now pretended that mister turner was also on his way to the border, pursued by sheriffs' officers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0177.wav|the fact was, wakefield went on to say, an uncle of his had advanced mister turner sixty thousand pounds, which had temporarily staved off ruin.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0178.wav|but another bank had since failed, and nothing could save mister turner but the transfer of some property to miss turner, and its settlement on her,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0179.wav|so that it might become the exclusive property of her husband, "whoever he might be."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0180.wav|wakefield added that it had been suggested he should marry miss turner, but that he had laughed at the idea.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0181.wav|wakefield's uncle took the matter more seriously, and declared that unless the marriage came off mister turner must be sold up.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0182.wav|miss turner, thus pressed, consented to go on to gretna green.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0183.wav|passing through carlisle, she was told that mister turner was in the town, but could not show himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0184.wav|nothing could release him from his trouble but the arrival of the marriage certificate from gretna green.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0185.wav|filial affection rose superior to all scruples, and miss turner, having crossed the border, was married to wakefield
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0186.wav|by the blacksmith in the usual way.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0187.wav|returning to carlisle, she now heard that her father had been set free, and had gone home to shrigley, whither they were to follow him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0188.wav|they set out, but at leeds wakefield found himself called suddenly to paris;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0189.wav|the other brother was accordingly sent on a pretended mission to shrigley to bring mister turner on to london, whither wakefield and miss turner also proceeded.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0191.wav|the strangely married couple thereupon pressed on to dover, and crossed over to calais.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0192.wav|the fact of the abduction did not transpire for some days.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0193.wav|then misses daulby learnt that miss turner had not arrived at shrigley, but that she had gone to manchester.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0194.wav|friends went in pursuit and traced her to huddersfield and further north.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0195.wav|the terror and dismay of her parents were soon intensified by the receipt of a letter from wakefield, at carlisle, announcing the marriage.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0198.wav|an uncle of miss wakefield's, accompanied by his solicitor and a bow street runner, at once went in pursuit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0199.wav|meanwhile, a second letter turned up from wakefield at calais, in which he assured misses turner that miss turner was fondly attached to him,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0200.wav|and went on to say, "i do assure you, madam, that it shall be the anxious endeavor of my life to promote her happiness by every means in my power."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0201.wav|the game, however, was nearly up. miss turner was met by her uncle on calais pier as she was walking with wakefield.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0247.wav|mister mullay became alarmed, and as mister owen did not appear, withdrew;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0248.wav|howard, strange to say, making no attempt to detain him; probably because mullay promised to return a few days later, and to bring more money.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0251.wav|mullay protested, and then howard, under the influence of ungovernable rage, as it seemed, jumped up,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0252.wav|locked the door, and attacked mullay violently with the trap ball bat and knife.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0253.wav|mullay defended himself, and managed to break the knife, but not before he had cut himself severely.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0258.wav|the defense he set up was, that mullay had used epithets towards him while they were negotiating a business matter,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0285.wav|the door of his place of durance stood open, and mister gee began to consider whether he might not escape.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ011-0287.wav|but at length managed to wriggle out of the chain which confined his body, and soon loosened the ropes round his feet.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0022.wav|he early saw the profits to be made out of purchasing stolen goods, but could not embark in it at first for want of capital.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0023.wav|he was taken up when still in his teens for stealing a pocketbook, and was sentenced to transportation, but did not get beyond the hulks at chatham.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0026.wav|with this capital he returned to london and set up as a fence.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0027.wav|he had such great aptitude for business, and such a thorough knowledge of the real value of goods,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0028.wav|that he was soon admitted to be one of the best judges known of all kinds of property, from a glass bottle to a five hundred guinea chronometer.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0029.wav|but he never paid more than a fixed price for all articles of the same class, whatever their intrinsic value.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0030.wav|thus, a watch was paid for as a watch, whether it was of gold or silver; a piece of linen as such, whether the stuff was coarse or fine.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0031.wav|this rule in dealing with stolen goods continues to this day, and has made the fortune of many since ikey.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0032.wav|solomons also established a system of provincial agency, by which stolen goods were passed on from london to the seaports, and so abroad.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0036.wav|on one occasion the whole of the proceeds of a robbery from a boot shop was traced to solomons';
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0037.wav|the owner came with the police, and was morally convinced that it was his property,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0038.wav|but could not positively identify it, and ikey defied them to remove a single shoe.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0039.wav|in the end the injured bootmaker agreed to buy back his stolen stock
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0040.wav|at the price solomons had paid for it, and it cost him about a hundred pounds to re stock his shop with his own goods.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0041.wav|as a general rule ikey solomons confined his purchases to small articles, mostly of jewelery and plate,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0043.wav|he lived in rosemary lane, and sometimes he had as much as twenty thousand pounds worth of goods secreted on the premises.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0044.wav|when his trade was busiest he set up a second establishment, at the head of which, although he was married,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0046.wav|the second house was in lower queen street, islington, and he used it for some time as a depot for valuables.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0048.wav|and this, with the danger arising from an extensive robbery of watches in cheapside, in which ikey was implicated as a receiver,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0049.wav|led him to think seriously of trying his fortunes in another land.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0050.wav|he was about to emigrate to new south wales, when he was arrested at islington and committed to newgate on a charge of receiving stolen goods.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0051.wav|while thus incarcerated he managed to escape from custody, but not actually from jail, by an ingenious contrivance which is worth mentioning.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0056.wav|after a short carouse the prisoner went into westminster, his case was heard, bail refused, and he was ordered back to newgate.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0061.wav|on stopping at a door in this low street, ikey jumped out, ran into the house, slamming the door behind him.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0063.wav|by and by the turnkeys, sobered by their loss, returned to newgate alone, and pleaded in excuse that they had been drugged.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0067.wav|but misses solomons could not resist the temptation to dabble in stolen goods, and she was found shipping watches of the wrong category to new york.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0224.wav|who examined bishop and his fellows, and further incriminating evidence adduced, to the effect that the prisoners had bartered for a coach to carry "a stiff 'un";

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0227.wav|one that of the murder of the italian boy, the other that of a boy unknown.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0228.wav|the evidence from first to last was circumstantial,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0229.wav|but the jury, after a short deliberation, did not hesitate to bring in a verdict of guilty, and all three were condemned to death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0230.wav|shortly before the day fixed for execution, bishop made a full confession, the bulk of which bore the impress of truth,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0231.wav|although it included statements that were improbable and unsubstantiated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0232.wav|he asserted that the victim was a lincolnshire lad, and not an italian boy, although the latter was fully proved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0233.wav|according to the confession, death had been inflicted by drowning in a well, whereas the medical evidence all pointed to violence.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0234.wav|it was, however, pretty clear that this victim, like preceding ones, had been lured to nova scotia gardens, and there drugged with a large dose of laudanum.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0241.wav|the memory of which is still fresh in the minds of londoners, although half a century has passed since it was committed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0242.wav|the horror with which greenacre's crime struck the town was unparalleled since the time when catherine hayes slew her husband.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0243.wav|there were many features of resemblance in these crimes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0244.wav|the decapitation and dismemberment, the bestowal of the remains in various parts of the town, the preservation of the head in spirits of wine,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0245.wav|in the hope that the features might some day be recognized, were alike in both.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0246.wav|the murder in both cases was long a profound mystery. in this which i am now describing,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0249.wav|returned a verdict of willful murder against some person unknown.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0250.wav|on the seventh july, eighteen thirty seven,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0251.wav|the lockman of "ben jonson lock," in stepney fields, found a human head jammed into the lock gates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0252.wav|closer investigation proved that it belonged to the trunk already discovered on the second february.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0253.wav|a further discovery was made in an osier bed near cold harbor lane, camberwell,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0254.wav|where a workman found a bundle containing two human legs, in a drain.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0255.wav|these were the missing members of the same mutilated trunk,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0256.wav|and there was now evidence sufficient to establish conclusively that the woman thus collected piecemeal had been barbarously done to death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0257.wav|but the affair still remained a profound mystery. no light was thrown upon it till, towards the end of march,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0258.wav|a mister gay of goodge street came to view the head, and immediately recognized it as that of a widowed sister, hannah brown,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0260.wav|the murdered individual was thus identified. the next step was to ascertain where and with whom she had last been seen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0261.wav|this brought suspicion on to a certain james greenacre,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0262.wav|whom she was to have married, and in whose company she had left her own lodgings to visit his in camberwell.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0263.wav|the police wished to refer to greenacre, but as he was not forthcoming,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0264.wav|a warrant was issued for his apprehension, which was effected at kennington on the twenty fourth march.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0265.wav|a woman named gale, who lived with him, was arrested at the same time. the prisoners were examined at the marylebone police court.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0267.wav|but his despair must have been great, as was evident from his attempt to strangle himself in the station house.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0268.wav|suspicion grew almost to certainty as the evidence was unfolded.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0269.wav|misses brown was a washer woman, supposed to be worth some money; hence greenacre's offer of marriage.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0270.wav|she had realized all her effects, and brought them with her furniture to greenacre's lodgings. the two when married were to emigrate to hudson's bay.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0271.wav|whether it was greed or a quarrel that drove greenacre to the desperate deed remains obscure.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0272.wav|they were apparently good friends when last seen together at a neighbor's, where they seemed "perfectly happy and sociable, and eager for the wedding day."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0273.wav|but greenacre in his confession pretended that he and his intended had quarreled over her property or the want of it,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0274.wav|and that in a moment of anger he knocked her down.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0275.wav|he thought he had killed her, and in his terror began at once to consider how he might dispose of the body and escape arrest.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0276.wav|while she was senseless, but really still alive, he cut off her head, and dismembered the body in the manner already described.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0277.wav|it is scarcely probable that he would have gone to this extremity if he had had no previous evil intention,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0278.wav|and the most probable inference is that he inveigled misses brown to his lodgings with the set purpose of taking her life.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0279.wav|his measures for the disposal of the corpus delicti remind us of those taken by misses hayes and her associates,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0280.wav|or of gardelle's frantic efforts to conceal his crime.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0281.wav|the most ghastly part of the story is that which deals with his getting rid of the head.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0282.wav|this, wrapped up in a silk handkerchief,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0283.wav|he carried under his coat flaps through the streets, and afterwards on his cap in a crowded city omnibus.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0284.wav|it was not until he left the bus, and walked up by the regent's canal, that he conceived the idea of throwing the head into the water.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0285.wav|another day elapsed before he got rid of the rest of the body,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0286.wav|all of which, according to his own confession, made no doubt with the idea of exonerating misses gale, he accomplished without her assistance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0287.wav|on the other hand, it was adduced in evidence that misses gale had been at his lodgings the very day after the murder,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0288.wav|and was seen to be busily engaged in washing down the house with bucket and mop.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0289.wav|greenacre, when tried at the old bailey, admitted that he had been guilty of manslaughter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0290.wav|while conversing with misses brown, he declared the unfortunate woman was rocking herself to and fro in a chair;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0291.wav|as she leant back he put his foot against the chair, and so tilted it over.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0292.wav|misses brown fell with it, and greenacre, to his horror, found that she was dead.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0293.wav|but the medical evidence was clear that the decapitation had been effected during life, and the jury, after a short deliberation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0294.wav|without hesitation brought in a verdict of willful murder.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0295.wav|the woman gale was also found guilty, but sentence of death was only passed on greenacre.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ012-0296.wav|the execution was, as usual, attended by an immense concourse, and greenacre died amidst the loudest execrations.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0008.wav|came to light in this same year, eighteen forty one.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0009.wav|this was the willful shipwreck and casting away of a vessel which, with her supposed cargo, had been heavily insured.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0010.wav|the 'dryad' was a brig owned principally by two persons named wallace, one a seaman, the other merchant.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0012.wav|her owners insured her for a full sum of two thousand pounds, after which the wallaces insured her privily

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0016.wav|it was fully proved in evidence that when the dryad sailed she carried nothing but the cargo belonging to zulueta and company

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ013-0025.wav|but another ship, concluding that he was acting in ignorance, rendered him assistance.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0128.wav|her hair was dressed in long crepe bands. she had lace ruffles at her wrist, and wore primrose colored kid gloves.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0131.wav|but misses manning, speaking in a foreign accent, addressed the court with great fluency and vehemence.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0132.wav|she complained that she had no justice; there was no law for her, she had found no protection either from judges, the prosecutor, or her husband.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0133.wav|she had not been treated like a christian, but like a wild beast of the forest. she declared that the money found in her possession had been sent her from abroad;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0134.wav|that o'connor had been more to her than her husband, that she ought to have married him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0135.wav|it was against common sense to charge her with murdering the only friend she had in the world;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0136.wav|the culprit was really her husband, who killed o'connor out of jealousy and revengeful feelings.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0138.wav|misses manning became still more violent, shouting, "no, no, i will not stand it! you ought to be ashamed of yourselves!"

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0141.wav|and stretching out her hand, she gathered up a quantity of the rue which, following ancient custom dating from the days of the jail fever,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0142.wav|was strewn in front of the dock, and sprinkled it towards the bench with a contemptuous gesture.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0143.wav|on being removed to newgate from the court misses manning became perfectly furious.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0144.wav|she uttered loud imprecations, cursing judge, jury, barristers, witnesses, and all who stood around.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0146.wav|they had to handcuff her by force against the most violent resistance, and still she raged and stormed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0147.wav|shaking her clenched and manacled hands in the officers' faces.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0148.wav|from newgate the mannings were taken in separate cabs to horsemonger lane jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0149.wav|on this journey her manner changed completely. she became flippant, joked with the officers, asked how they liked her "resolution" in the dock,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0150.wav|and expressed the utmost contempt for her husband, whom she never intended to acknowledge or speak to again.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0151.wav|later her mood changed to abject despair.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0152.wav|on reaching the condemned cell she threw herself upon the floor and shrieked in an hysterical agony of tears.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0153.wav|after this, until the day of execution, she recovered her spirits, and displayed reckless effrontery,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0154.wav|mocking at the chaplain, and turning a deaf ear to the counsels of a benevolent lady who came to visit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0155.wav|now she abused the jury, now called manning a vagabond,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0156.wav|and through all ate heartily at every meal, slept soundly at nights, and talked with cheerfulness on almost any subject.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0157.wav|nevertheless, she attempted to commit suicide by driving her nails, purposely left long, into her throat.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0159.wav|manning's demeanor was more in harmony with his situation, and the full confession he made
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0160.wav|elucidated all dark and uncertain points in connection with the crime.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0294.wav|and in the middle of the night one of the fellow prisoners who slept in the same ward noticed that he was not in his bed.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0306.wav|these had been attributed to political action; some thought that the large purchases in foreign grains, effected at losing prices,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0323.wav|the warrant thus represented money, and was often used as such, being endorsed and passed from hand to hand as other negotiable bills.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0324.wav|cole's plan was to have a wharf of his own, nominally occupied by a creature trading as maltby and company
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0325.wav|goods would be landed at this wharf;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0326.wav|maltby and company would issue warrants on them deliverable to the importer, and the goods were then passed to be stored in neighboring warehouses.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0329.wav|and so developed his business that in one year his transactions amounted to a couple of millions of pounds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0330.wav|he had several narrow escapes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ014-0331.wav|once a warrant holder sent down a clerk to view certain goods, and the clerk found that these goods had already a "stop" upon them, or were pledged.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0064.wav|been afforded peculiar facilities by the slackness of system and the want of methodical administration in the concerns by which they were employed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0065.wav|robson was of humble origin, but he was well educated, and he had some literary abilities.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0079.wav|the temptation was all the greater because the chances of successful fraud lay ready to hand.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0085.wav|with the proceeds of these flagitious frauds robson feasted and made merry.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0086.wav|he kept open house at kilburn priory;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0087.wav|entertained literary, artistic, and dramatic celebrities; had a smart "turn out," attended all the race meetings, and dressed in the latest fashion.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0088.wav|to his wife, poor soul, he made no pretense of fidelity, and she enjoyed only so much of his company as was necessarily spent
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0089.wav|in receiving guests at home, or could be spared from two rival establishments in other parts of the town.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0090.wav|to account for his revenues he pretended to have been very lucky on the stock exchange, which was at one time true to a limited extent,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0091.wav|and to have succeeded in other speculations.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0092.wav|when his friends asked why he, a wealthy man of independent means, continued to slave on as a clerk on a pittance,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0093.wav|he replied gaily that his regular work at the crystal palace office was useful as a sort of discipline, and kept him steady.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0094.wav|all this time his position was one of extreme insecurity. he was standing over a mine which at any moment might explode.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0095.wav|the blow fell suddenly, and when least expected. one morning mister fasson asked casually for certain certificates,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0096.wav|whether representing real or fictitious shares does not appear; but they were certificates connected in some way with robson's long practiced frauds
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0097.wav|and he could not produce them. his chief asked sternly where they were.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0098.wav|robson said they were at kilburn priory.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0099.wav|"let us go to kilburn for them together," said mister fasson, growing suspicious.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0100.wav|they drove there, and robson on arrival did the honors of his house, rang for lunch to gain time,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0101.wav|but at mister fasson's pressing demands went upstairs to fetch the certificates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0102.wav|he came back to explain that he had mislaid them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0103.wav|mister fasson, more and more ill at ease, would not accept this subterfuge, and declared they must be found.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0104.wav|robson again left him, but only to gather together hastily all the money and valuables on which he could lay his hands, with which he left the house.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0105.wav|mister fasson waited and waited for his subordinate to re appear, and at last discovered his flight.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0106.wav|a reward was forthwith offered for robson's apprehension.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0107.wav|meanwhile the absconding clerk had coolly driven to a favorite dining place in the west end,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0108.wav|where a fish curry and a brace of partridges were set before him,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0109.wav|and he discussed the latter with appetite, but begged that they would never give him curry again, as he did not like it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0110.wav|after dinner he went into hiding for a day or two,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0111.wav|then, accompanied by a lady, not misses robson, he took steamer and started for copenhagen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0112.wav|but the continental police had been warned to look out for him, and two danish inspectors got upon his track,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0113.wav|followed him over to sweden, and arrested him at helsingfors.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0114.wav|thence he was transferred to copenhagen and surrendered in due course to a london police officer.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0115.wav|little more remains to be said about robson. he appears to have accepted his position, and to have at once resigned himself to his fate.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0118.wav|paid him the compliment of describing him as "a young man of great intelligence, considerable powers of mind,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0119.wav|and possessed of an education very much beyond the rank of life to which he originally belonged."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0120.wav|robson was found guilty, and sentenced to two terms of transportation, one for twenty and one for fourteen years.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0123.wav|in many respects the embezzlement of which leopold redpath was guilty closely resembled that of robson,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0124.wav|but it was based upon more extended and audacious forgeries.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0125.wav|redpath's crime arose from his peculiar and independent position as registrar of stock of the great northern railway company.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0126.wav|this offered him great facilities for the creation of artificial stock, its sale from a fictitious holder, and transfer to himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0127.wav|all the signatures in the transfer were forged. not only did he thus transfer and realize "bogus" stock
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0128.wav|but he bought bona fide amounts, and increased their value by altering the figures,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0129.wav|by inserting say one before five hundred, and thus making it
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0130.wav|fifteen hundred pounds, which larger amount was duly carried to his credit on the register, and entered upon the certificates of transfer.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0131.wav|by these means redpath misappropriated vast sums during a period extending over ten years.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0132.wav|the total amount was never exactly made out, but the false stock created and issued by him was estimated at two hundred twenty thousand pounds.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0138.wav|his fault was generosity,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0139.wav|an open handed, unthinking charity which gave freely to the poor and needy the money which belonged to his creditors.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0180.wav|was densely crowded, and many curious eyes were turned upon the somewhat remarkable man who occupied the dock.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0181.wav|he is described by a contemporary account as a fresh looking man of forty years of age, slightly bald, inclined to embonpoint,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0183.wav|his manner was generally self possessed, but his face was marked with "uneasy earnestness,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0184.wav|and he looked about him with wayward, furtive glances.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0185.wav|when the jury found a verdict of guilty he remained unmoved. he listened without emotion to the judge's well merited censures,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0193.wav|by and by, when escape seemed hopeless, and after sentence, he suddenly degenerated into the lowest stamp of criminal,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0194.wav|and behaved so as to justify a belief that he had been a jail bird all his life.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0195.wav|it has been already remarked in these pages that with changed social conditions came a great change in the character of crimes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0196.wav|highway robberies, for instance, had disappeared, if we except the spasmodic and severely repressed outbreak of "garotting,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0197.wav|which at one time spread terror throughout london. thieves preferred now to use ingenuity rather than brute force.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0198.wav|it was no longer possible to stop a coach or carriage, or rob the postman who carried the mail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0199.wav|the improved methods of locomotion had put a stop to these depredations. people traveled in company, as a rule;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0200.wav|only when single and unprotected were they in any danger of attack, and that but rarely.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0201.wav|there were still big prizes, however, to tempt the daring, and none appealed more to the thievish instinct than the custom of transmitting gold by rail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0202.wav|the precious metal was sent from place to place carefully locked up and guarded, no doubt;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0203.wav|but were the precautions too minute, the vigilance too close to be eluded or overcome?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0204.wav|this was the question which presented itself to the fertile brain of one pierce,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0205.wav|who had been concerned in various "jobs" of a dishonest character, and who for the moment was a clerk in a betting office.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0206.wav|he laid the suggestion before agar, a professional thief, who was of opinion it contained elements of success.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0207.wav|but the collusion and active assistance of employees of the railway carriers were indispensable, and together
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0208.wav|they sounded one burgess, a guard on the south eastern railway, a line by which large quantities of bullion were sent to the continent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0209.wav|burgess detailed the whole system of transmission.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0210.wav|the gold, packed in an iron bound box, was securely lodged in safes locked with patent chubbs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0211.wav|each safe had three sets of double keys, all held by confidential servants of the company.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0212.wav|one pair was with the traffic superintendent in london, another with an official in folkestone,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0213.wav|a third with the captain of the folkestone and boulogne boat.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0214.wav|at the other side of the channel the french railway authorities took charge.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0215.wav|the safes while on the line en route between london and folkestone were in the guard's van.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0216.wav|this was an important step, and they might easily be robbed some day when burgess was the guard, provided only that they could be opened.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0217.wav|the next step was to get impressions and fabricate false keys.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0218.wav|a new accomplice was now needed within the company's establishment, and pierce looked about long before he found the right person.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0219.wav|at last he decided to enlist one tester, a clerk in the traffic department, whom he thought would prove a likely tool.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0220.wav|the four waited patiently for their opportunity,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0221.wav|which came when the safes were sent to chubbs' to be repaired; and chubbs sent them back, but only with one key,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0222.wav|in such a way that tester had possession of this key for a time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0223.wav|he lent it to agar for a brief space, who promptly took an impression on wax. but the safes had a double lock;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0224.wav|the difficulty was to get a copy of the second key.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0225.wav|this was at length effected by agar and pierce.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0226.wav|after hanging about the folkestone office for some time, they saw at last that the key was kept in a certain cupboard.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0227.wav|still watching and waiting for the first chance, they seized it when the clerks left the office empty for a moment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0228.wav|pierce boldly stepped in, found the cupboard unlocked; he removed the key, handed it to agar outside,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0229.wav|who quickly took the wax impression, handed it back to pierce; pierce replaced it, left the office, and the thing was done.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0230.wav|after this nothing remained but to wait for some occasion when the amount transmitted would be sufficient to justify the risks of robbery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0231.wav|it was tester's business, who had access to the railway company's books, to watch for this.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0232.wav|meanwhile the others completed their preparations with the utmost care.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0233.wav|a weight of shot was bought and stowed in carpet bags ready to replace exactly the abstracted gold.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0234.wav|courier bags were bought to carry the "stuff" slung over the shoulders;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0235.wav|and last, but not least, agar frequently traveled up and down the line to test the false keys he had manufactured with pierce's assistance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0236.wav|burgess admitted him into the guard's van, where he fitted and filed the keys till they worked easily and satisfactorily in the locks of the safe.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0237.wav|one night tester whispered to agar and pierce, "all right," as they cautiously lounged about london bridge.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0238.wav|the thieves took first class tickets, handed their bags full of shot to the porters, who placed them in the guard's van.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0239.wav|just as the train was starting agar slipped into the van with burgess, and pierce got into a first class carriage.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0241.wav|opened it, took out and broke into the bullion box, removed the gold, substituted the shot from a carpet bag,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0242.wav|re fastened and re sealed the bullion box, and replaced it in the safe.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0243.wav|at redhill tester met the train and relieved the thieves of a portion of the stolen gold.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0244.wav|at the same station pierce joined agar in the guard's van, and there were now three to carry on the robbery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0245.wav|the two remaining safes were attacked and nearly entirely despoiled in the same way as the first, and the contents transferred to the courier bags.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0247.wav|at that station the safes were given out, heavy with shot, not gold; the thieves went on to dover, and by and by,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0248.wav|with ostend tickets previously procured, returned to london without mishap, and by degrees disposed of much of the stolen gold.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0253.wav|he handed over to pierce a sum of three thousand pounds, his own, whether rightly or wrongly acquired never came out,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0254.wav|together with the unrealized part of the bullion, amounting in all to some fifteen thousand pounds,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0255.wav|and begged his accomplice to invest it as a settlement on a woman named kay, by whom he had had a child.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0256.wav|pierce made kay only a few small payments, then appropriated the rest of the money.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0258.wav|went to the police in great fury and distress, and disclosed all she knew of the affair.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0259.wav|agar too, in newgate, heard how pierce had treated him, and at once readily turned approver.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0282.wav|like his great predecessor old patch, he never went to a bank himself, nor did any of his accomplices.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0283.wav|the bearer of the cheque was always innocent and ignorant of the fraudulent nature of the document he presented.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0284.wav|in order to obtain messengers of this sort, saward answered advertisements of persons seeking employment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0285.wav|and when these presented themselves, entrusted them as a beginning with the duty of cashing cheques.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0286.wav|a confederate followed the emissary closely,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0287.wav|not only to ensure fair play and the surrender of the proceeds if the cheque was cashed, but to give timely notice if it was not,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0288.wav|so that saward and the rest might make themselves scarce.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0289.wav|as each transaction was carried out from a different address, and a different messenger always employed,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0291.wav|partly through their own carelessness, when transferring their operations to yarmouth.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0294.wav|he forgot to add that it was to be placed to ralph's credit, and when he called as ralph,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0295.wav|he was told it was only at mister whitney's disposal, and that it could be paid to no one else.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0297.wav|and that clever schemer sent an elaborate letter of instructions how to ask for the money.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0298.wav|but while hardwicke was in communication with saward, the bank was in communication with london
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ015-0299.wav|and the circumstances were deemed sufficiently suspicious to warrant the arrest of the gentlemen at yarmouth on a charge of forgery and conspiracy.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0019.wav|and climbed up the pipe of a cistern in the corner of the press yard; some thought with the idea of drowning himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0020.wav|he never reached the cistern, but fell back into the yard, injuring his legs severely.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0031.wav|yet from the circumstantial account given by williams after recapture, there can be little doubt that he got away as will be described.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0032.wav|williams as a capital convict was lodged in the press yard or condemned ward.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0033.wav|he had access to the airing yard, and there was for hours no kind of supervision.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0034.wav|in one corner of the airing yard stood a cistern at some height from the ground;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0035.wav|the wall beneath and above it was "rusticated," in other words, the granite surface had become roughened, and offered a sort of foothold.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0036.wav|about fifty feet from the ground level, and above the cistern, a revolving chevaux de frise of iron was fixed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0037.wav|with only a short interval between it and the wall, supported by a horizontal iron railing with upright points;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0038.wav|in the wall above the chevaux de frise projected a series of iron spikes sharp enough to forbid further ascent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0039.wav|williams surveyed these formidable obstacles to evasion, and calmly proceeded to surmount them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0040.wav|his first task was to gain the top of the cistern; this he effected by keeping his back to one side of the angle,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0041.wav|and working with his hands behind him, while he used his bare feet like claws upon the other side of the wall angle.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0042.wav|the condition of the stone surface just mentioned assisted him in this, and he managed to get beyond the cistern to the railing below the chevaux de frise.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0043.wav|the least slip now would have been fatal to him. but he could not thrust his body in through the narrow space left by the chevaux de frise,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0044.wav|and was compelled to work along the railing round three quarters of the square of the yard,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0045.wav|and at length reached a point opposite the top of the building containing the condemned wards. this had been a perilous and painful task;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0046.wav|the spikes of the railing penetrated his flesh and made progression slow and difficult.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0047.wav|but the worst part of the business was to jump from this irksome foothold of the iron grating on to the top of the building just mentioned,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0048.wav|a distance of eight or nine feet.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0049.wav|he had here completed his ascent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0050.wav|his next job was to descend outside newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0051.wav|clambering along the roof,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0052.wav|he passed to the top of the ordinary's residence, hoping to find an open sky light by which he might enter and so work downstairs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0053.wav|if the worst came to the worst, he intended to have gone down some chimney, as he had often done before in the way of business.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0054.wav|but he did not like the risk of entering a room by the fireplace, and the chances of detection it offered.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0055.wav|he traversed vainly all the roofs in newgate street,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0056.wav|running a great risk of discovery as he passed by a lot of workmen at tyler's manufactory in warwick square, which had formerly been the college of physicians.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0057.wav|as his coat was an encumbrance, he left it on the top of the third house in newgate street, and thus in shirt sleeves, barefoot and bareheaded,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0058.wav|he worked along to the roofs in warwick lane.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0059.wav|here he came upon a woman on the leads hanging out clothes to dry.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0060.wav|williams concealed himself behind a chimney till she had re entered her garret,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0061.wav|and then following her down a step ladder into the house, told his story, appealed to and won her compassion.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0062.wav|she suffered him to pass downstairs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0063.wav|below he met another woman and a girl, both of whom were terrified at his appearance, but
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0064.wav|when he explained that he was running away from the gallows they left him the road clear.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0065.wav|to walk out into the street was an easy affair, and he was now free, with one and fourpence in his pocket and a shirt and trousers for all his clothing.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0068.wav|and continued his march to kingston, where he slept soundly under a hedge till next morning.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0069.wav|entering a town, he obtained employment at once as a chimney sweep
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0070.wav|from a widow woman, who gave him "bub and grub," or food and one and sixpence, for every nine days' work.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0071.wav|dissatisfied with this remuneration, he again took to the road, and tramped into hampshire,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0075.wav|it was for some time after this a constant practice to go up the chimneys in the hopes of escaping by the flue.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0079.wav|lears was rewarded by being obliged to wear cross irons on his legs, a punishment rarely inflicted in newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0080.wav|and probably one of the few cases of a recurrence, but under proper safeguards and limitations, to the old system of chains.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0081.wav|on another occasion mister cope the governor came in and missed a man.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0082.wav|the ward was one short of its number. what had become of the fellow?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0084.wav|the fugitive, uncomfortably ensconced in the flue, came down of his own accord, like colonel colt's raccoon.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0145.wav|encouraged by the shouts and signals of some workmen employed on a building outside, the prisoner made one of the most marvellous jumps on record,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0159.wav|who contrived to hang himself from a hammock hook only eighteen inches from the ground.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0160.wav|the noose was one of his hammock straps, which he buckled round his throat.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0161.wav|having carefully spread out a blanket on the floor just below the hammock as it lay suspended,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0162.wav|he fastened one end of the strap above mentioned to the hook, and then fell down.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0163.wav|he might have saved himself at any moment by merely extending an arm; but he lay there patiently till death supervened.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0164.wav|when discovered next morning, quite dead, it was found that the strap actually did not touch his throat;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0165.wav|three fingers might have been inserted between it and the flesh; the pressure was all on the arteries behind the ears,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0168.wav|a laudable desire to invest executions with more and more solemnity and decorum gained ground as they became more rare.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0169.wav|as more humane principles were introduced into prison management,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0170.wav|greater attention was paid to the capital convicts, and the horrors of their situation while awaiting sentence
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0171.wav|were as far as possible mitigated and toned down. but there was little improvement in the ceremony itself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0172.wav|there were still untoward accidents occasionally at executions, and even the chief practitioner of recent times, calcraft,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0173.wav|was not always to be trusted to do his fell work efficiently.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0174.wav|having mentioned calcraft's name,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0175.wav|i may be permitted to digress for a moment to give a few particulars concerning the last officially appointed hangman of the city of london.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0176.wav|after calcraft's resignation no successor was really appointed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0177.wav|marwood, whose name is so familiar with the present generation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0178.wav|had no official status, and was merely an operator selected by the corporation, and who, on the strength of it,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0179.wav|contracted with sheriffs and conveners to work by the job.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0180.wav|but calcraft regularly succeeded foxen, who followed botting, and dennis, the actor in the seventeen eighty riots.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0181.wav|calcraft was born at baddow, in essex, in eighteen hundred;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0182.wav|he was a shoemaker by trade, and settled in london after his marriage in eighteen twenty five.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0183.wav|the story goes, that about eighteen twenty eight
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0184.wav|his attention was drawn early one morning to a man who leant against a lamp post in finsbury square, coughing violently.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0185.wav|calcraft, who, in spite of the dreadful calling he subsequently followed, was always reputed a kindly man,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0186.wav|invited the man with the cough to enter a neighboring house and try a little peppermint for it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0187.wav|the other accepted, and they got into conversation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0188.wav|he told calcraft that he was foxen the executioner, and that he was that moment on his way to newgate to hang a man,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0189.wav|but that his cough was getting so much the master of him that he feared he would not be able to carry on his duties much longer.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0190.wav|"i have no idea who the sheriffs will get to do the work after me," said foxen, adding that his assistant, tom cheshire,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0191.wav|was given to drink, and not to be trusted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0192.wav|"i think i could do that sort of job," said calcraft, on the spur of the moment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0193.wav|foxen asked him his name and address, and went away.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0194.wav|calcraft thought no more of what had occurred till the next sessions at the old bailey, when the sheriffs sent for him,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0195.wav|and offered him the post of executioner for the city of london and middlesex.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0196.wav|he accepted, having at first tom cheshire as his assistant, then for a time, when cheshire was dismissed for drunkenness, a man named osborne.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0197.wav|after that he worked alone.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0198.wav|i cannot find that calcraft was sworn in when appointed, or any exact information when the old forbidding ceremony ceased to be practiced.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0199.wav|it was customary to make the executioner take the bible in his hand, and swear solemnly that he would dispatch every criminal condemned to die,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0200.wav|without favoring father or mother or any other relation or friend.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0201.wav|when he had taken the oath he was dismissed with the words, "get thee hence, wretch!"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0202.wav|calcraft's emoluments were a guinea per week, and an extra guinea for every execution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0203.wav|he got besides half a crown for every man he flogged, and an allowance to provide cats or birch rods.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0205.wav|he received a retaining fee of five pounds, five shillings, with the usual guinea for each job;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0206.wav|he was also at liberty to engage himself in the country, where he demanded and was paid ten pounds on each occasion.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0207.wav|it was not always easy to get a hangman so cheap, as i have already indicated on a previous page.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0208.wav|the onus and responsibility of carrying out the sentence is personal to the sheriff. a good story is told illustrating this.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0209.wav|some wags in scotland seized calcraft and kept him in durance the night before the execution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0210.wav|meanwhile the convener or sheriff was in despair, expecting that, failing the executioner, he would have to do the job himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0211.wav|but, fortunately for him, just at the last moment calcraft was set free.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0212.wav|calcraft's salary was more than the proverbial "thirteenpence halfpenny hangman's wages."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0213.wav|the origin of this expression dates, it is said, from the time when the scottish mark,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0214.wav|a silver coin bearing the same relation to the scottish pound that an english shilling does to an english pound, was made to pass current in england.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0215.wav|the mark was valued at thirteenpence halfpenny, or rather more than the shilling, which from time immemorial had been the hangman's wages.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0216.wav|that very ancient perquisite the convict's clothes was never claimed by calcraft, and it may be doubted whether he was entitled to it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0217.wav|on one particular occasion, however, he got them. a gentleman whose sins brought him to the gallows at maidstone
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0218.wav|wished to do calcraft a good turn, and sent to his london tailor for a complete new suit, in which he appeared at his execution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0219.wav|he expressly bequeathed them to calcraft, who was graciously pleased to accept them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0220.wav|on another occasion an importunate person begged calcraft eagerly to claim his right to the clothes, and give them to him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0221.wav|calcraft consented, got and bestowed the clothes, only to find that the person he had obliged exhibited them publicly.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0222.wav|it may be added that of late years the clothes in which a convict has suffered are invariably burnt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0223.wav|capital convicts go to the gallows in their own clothing, and not in prison dress, unless the former is quite unfit to be worn.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0224.wav|calcraft shared the odium which his office, not strangely, has always inspired. but he was admitted into the jail,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0225.wav|which his predecessors were not, and who were paid their wages over the gate to obviate the necessity for letting them enter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0226.wav|to this curious etiquette was due the appointment of an official whose office has long since disappeared, "the yeoman of the halter,"

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0231.wav|when he came to the prison for his wages his grandchildren often accompanied him, affectionately clinging to his hands;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0232.wav|and he owned a pet pony which would follow him about like a dog.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0234.wav|he was not unskilful, but he proceeded entirely by rule of thumb, leaving the result very much to chance and the strength of the rope.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0235.wav|he was so much in favor of short drops that his immediate successor, marwood, stigmatized him as "short drop" man.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0237.wav|with calcraft's method there were undoubtedly many failures, and it was a common custom for him to go below the gallows
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0238.wav|"just to steady their legs a little;" in other words, to add his weight to that of the hanging bodies.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0317.wav|but believed that a public ceremony destroyed the whole value of an execution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0318.wav|other officials, great lawyers, governors of prisons, and chaplains supported this view.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ016-0322.wav|the commission recommended that death sentences should be carried out within the jail, under such regulations as might be considered necessary

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0006.wav|the crime of poisoning has always been viewed with peculiar loathing and terror in this country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0007.wav|it will be remembered that as far back as the reign of henry the eighth a new and most cruel penalty was devised for the punishment of the bishop of rochester's cook,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0008.wav|who had poisoned his master and many of his dependents.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0009.wav|sir thomas overbury was undoubtedly poisoned by lord rochester in the reign of james the first,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0010.wav|and it is hinted that james himself nearly fell a victim to a nefarious attempt of the duke of buckingham.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0011.wav|but secret poisoning on a wholesale scale such as was practiced in italy and france was happily never popularized in england.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0013.wav|so called after its inventress, a roman woman named toffana, and which was so widely adopted by ladies anxious to get rid of their husbands,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0014.wav|was never introduced into this country. its admission was probably checked by the increased vigilance at the custom houses,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0022.wav|was that of eliza fenning, who was convicted of an attempt to poison a whole family
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0023.wav|by putting arsenic in the dumplings she had prepared for them. the charge rested entirely on circumstantial evidence,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0025.wav|the justice of the sentence was doubted at the time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0026.wav|yet it was clearly proved that the dumplings contained arsenic, that she, and she alone, had made the dough,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0085.wav|palmer's plan was to administer poison in quantities insufficient to cause death, but enough to produce illness which would account for death.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0087.wav|antimony, which caused cook's constant sickness.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0091.wav|the last act now approached, and in order to avoid the detection of this last fraud, palmer laid his plans for disposing of cook.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0092.wav|he decided to use strychnia, or the vegetable poison otherwise known as nux vomica;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0093.wav|and one of the many links in the long chain of evidence was an entry in a book of palmer's to the effect that quote.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0101.wav|that day palmer had bought more strychnia, and had called in a fresh doctor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0102.wav|the second attack was fatal, and ended in cook's death from tetanus.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0103.wav|this tetanus, according to the prosecution, was produced by strychnia, and followed the administration of pills by palmer

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0108.wav|he was struck with the appearance of the corpse, which was not emaciated, as after a long disease ending in death;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0109.wav|while the muscles of the fingers were tightly clenched, not open, as usual in a corpse.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0110.wav|he said nothing, but began to feel uneasy when he found that cook's betting book was missing, and that palmer put it forward
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0111.wav|that his friend had died greatly embarrassed, with bills to the amount of four thousand pounds out in his name.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0112.wav|palmer too showed an indecent haste in preparing the body for interment, and in obtaining the usual certificate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0113.wav|after this the step father insisted upon a post mortem, which was conducted somewhat carelessly.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0114.wav|the intestines were, however, preserved and sent for analysis,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0115.wav|but it was proved that palmer tried hard to get possession of the jar containing them,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0116.wav|and even sought to upset the vehicle by which they were being conveyed a part of the way to london.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0118.wav|and it was on the entire absence of the latter that the defense was principally based when palmer was brought to trial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0119.wav|all the circumstances were so suspicious that he could not escape the criminal charge.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0120.wav|he had already been arrested on a writ issued at the instance of the money lenders, and an action had been commenced against misses palmer on her acceptances.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0121.wav|it came out at once that these had been forged, and the whole affair at once took the ugliest complexion.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0122.wav|a government prosecution was instituted, and palmer was brought to newgate for trial at the central criminal court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0123.wav|there was not much reserve about him when there.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0124.wav|he frequently declared before and during the trial that it would be impossible to find him guilty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0125.wav|he never actually said that he was not guilty, but he was confident he would not be convicted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0126.wav|he relied on the absence of the strychnia.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0127.wav|but the chain of circumstantial evidence was strong enough to satisfy the jury, who agreed to their verdict in an hour.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0128.wav|at the last moment palmer tossed a bit of paper over to his counsel, on which he had written, quote, i think there will be a verdict of not guilty, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0129.wav|even after the death sentence had been passed upon him he clung to the hope that the government would grant him a reprieve.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0130.wav|to the last, therefore, he played the part of a man wrongfully convicted, and did not abandon hope
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0131.wav|even when the high sheriff had told him there was no possibility of a reprieve, and within a few hours of execution.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0133.wav|palmer speedily found imitators.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0134.wav|within a few weeks occurred the leeds poisoning case, in which the murderer undoubtedly was inspired by the facts made public at palmer's trial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0135.wav|dove, a fiendish brute, found from the evidence in that case that he could kill his wife, whom he hated,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0136.wav|with exquisite torture, and with a poison that would leave, as he thought, no trace.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0137.wav|in the latter hope he was happily disappointed. but as this case is beyond my subject, i merely mention it as one of the group already referred to.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0138.wav|three years later came the case of doctor smethurst,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0139.wav|presenting still greater features of resemblance with palmer's, for both were medical men, and both raised difficult questions of medical jurisprudence.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0140.wav|in both the jury had no doubt as to the guilt of the accused, only in smethurst's case the then home secretary, sir george cornewall lewis,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0141.wav|could not divest his mind of serious doubt, and of which the murderer got the benefit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0142.wav|smethurst's escape may have influenced the jury in the poplar poisoning case,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0143.wav|which followed close on its heels, although in that the verdict of "not guilty" was excusable, as the evidence was entirely circumstantial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0144.wav|there was no convincing proof that the accused had administered the poison, although beyond question that poison had occasioned the death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0145.wav|doctor smethurst was long an inmate of newgate, and was tried at the central criminal court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0146.wav|he had all the characteristics of the poisoner the calm deliberation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0147.wav|the protracted dissimulation, as with unshrinking, relentless wickedness the deadly work is carried on to the end.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0148.wav|smethurst's victim was a miss bankes, with whom he had contracted a bigamous marriage.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0149.wav|he had met her at a boarding house, where he lived with his own wife, a person of "shady" antecedents,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0150.wav|and whom he left without scruple to join miss bankes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0151.wav|the latter seems to have succumbed only too willingly to his fascinations, and to have as readily agreed to marry him,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0152.wav|in spite of the existence of the other misses smethurst.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0153.wav|probably the doctor had told her the story he brought forward when tried for bigamy, namely,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0154.wav|that misses smethurst had no right to the name, but had a husband of her own, one johnson, alive a story subsequently disproved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0155.wav|miss bankes seems to have counted upon some species of whitewashing, no less than the repudiation of the other marriage,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0156.wav|and told her sister as much when they last met.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0157.wav|for some months smethurst and miss bankes lived together as man and wife, first in london, and then at richmond.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0158.wav|she had a little fortune of her own, some one thousand seven hundred pounds or one thousand eight hundred pounds,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0159.wav|and a life interest in five thousand pounds, a fact on which smethurst's counsel dwelt with much weight,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0160.wav|as indicating a motive for keeping her alive rather than killing her.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0161.wav|but probably the lump sum was the bait, or perhaps smethurst wished to return to his temporarily deserted first wife.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0162.wav|whatever the exact cause which impelled him to crime, it seems certain that he began to give her some poison,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0163.wav|either arsenic or antimony, or both, in small quantities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0164.wav|with the idea of subjecting her to the irritant poison slowly but surely until the desired effect, death, was achieved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0165.wav|as she became worse and worse, smethurst called in the best medical advice in richmond,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0166.wav|but was careful to prime them with his facts and lead them if possible to accept his diagnosis of the case.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0167.wav|smethurst was found guilty by the jury, and sentenced to death.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0168.wav|but a long public discussion followed, and in consequence he was reprieved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0169.wav|the home secretary, in a letter to the lord chief baron, stated that, quote, although the facts are full of suspicion against smethurst,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0170.wav|there is not absolute and complete evidence of his guilt. end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0171.wav|smethurst was therefore given a free pardon for the offense of murder,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0172.wav|but he was subsequently again tried for bigamy, and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0173.wav|catherine wilson was a female poisoner who did business wholesale.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0174.wav|she was tried in april eighteen sixty two on suspicion of having attempted to poison a neighbor with oil of vitriol.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0175.wav|the circumstances were strange. misses wilson had gone to the chemist's for medicine,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0176.wav|and on her return had administered a dose of something which burnt the mouth badly, but did not prove fatal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0177.wav|wilson was acquitted on this charge, but other suspicious facts cropped up while she was in newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0178.wav|it appeared that several persons with whom she was intimate had succumbed suddenly.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0179.wav|in all cases the symptoms were much the same,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0180.wav|vomiting, violent retching, purging, such as are visible in cholera, and all dated from the time when she knew a young man named dixon,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0181.wav|who had been in the habit of taking colchicum for rheumatism. misses wilson heard then casually from a medical man
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0182.wav|that it was a very dangerous medicine, and she profited by what she had heard.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0183.wav|soon afterwards dixon died, showing all the symptoms already described.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0184.wav|soon afterwards a friend, misses atkinson, came to london from westmoreland, and stayed in misses wilson's house.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0185.wav|she was in good health on leaving home, and had with her a large sum of money.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0186.wav|while with misses wilson she became suddenly and alarmingly ill, and died in great agony.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0187.wav|her husband, who came up to town, would not allow a post mortem, and again misses wilson escaped.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0188.wav|misses atkinson's symptoms had been the same as dixon's. then misses wilson went to live with a man named taylor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0189.wav|who was presently attacked in the same way as the others, but, but, thanks to the prompt administration of remedies, he recovered.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0191.wav|last of all misses wilson poisoned her landlady, misses soames, under precisely the same conditions as the foregoing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0192.wav|here, however, the evidence was strong and sufficient.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0193.wav|it was proved that misses wilson had given misses soames something peculiar to drink,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0194.wav|that immediately afterwards misses soames was taken ill with vomiting and purging,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0195.wav|and that misses wilson administered the same medicine again and again.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0196.wav|the last time misses soames showed great reluctance to take it, but wilson said it would certainly do her good.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0198.wav|but its nature was betrayed when this last victim also died.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0199.wav|the first post mortem indicated death from natural causes,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0200.wav|but a more careful investigation attributed it beyond doubt to over doses of colchicum.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0201.wav|doctor alfred taylor, the great authority and writer on medical jurisprudence, corroborated this, and in his evidence on the trial
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0202.wav|fairly electrified the court by declaring it his opinion that many deaths, supposed to be from cholera, were really due to poison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ017-0203.wav|this fact was referred to by the judge in his summing up,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0027.wav|in little more than a week a cabman came forward and voluntarily made a statement which at once drew suspicion to a german, franz muller,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0134.wav|in this part of the mills a large quantity of bank note paper was kept at the period of the robbery,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0174.wav|and the prominent part he played secured for him on conviction the heaviest sentence of the law.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0206.wav|he was a tall, slender man, with a long face and iron gray hair.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0209.wav|it was not easy to detect coiners, or bring home their guilt to them.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0213.wav|which in dramatic interest can compare with the conviction of william roupell for forgery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0214.wav|as the case must still be well remembered by the present generation, it will be necessary to give here only the briefest summary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0215.wav|william roupell was the eldest but illegitimate son of a wealthy man who subsequently married roupell's mother, and had further legitimate issue.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0216.wav|william was brought up as an attorney, and became in due course his father's man of business.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0217.wav|as such he had pretty general control over his father's estates and affairs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0218.wav|in eighteen fifty five
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0219.wav|he instructed certain solicitors to prepare a deed of gift as from his father, conveying to him estates near kingston.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0220.wav|the old gentleman's signature to this deed of gift was a forgery,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0221.wav|but upon this forged and false conveyance william roupell, who had already embarked upon a career of wild extravagance,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0222.wav|obtained a mortgage of seven thousand pounds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0223.wav|in eighteen fifty six the father died.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0224.wav|it had been supposed up to this date that he had willed his property, amounting in all to upwards of two hundred thousand pounds,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0225.wav|but after the funeral william roupell produced another and a later will,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0226.wav|leaving everything to the widow, and constituting william sole executor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0227.wav|this will was a deliberate forgery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0228.wav|five or six years later, william roupell minutely described how he had effected the fraud.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0229.wav|the day his father died he got the keys of his private bureau, opened it, and took out the authentic will.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0230.wav|after reading it, and finding this unfavorable to himself, he resolved to carry out his deliberate plan,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0231.wav|namely, to suppress it and substitute another.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0232.wav|he himself prepared it on a blank form which he had brought with him on purpose.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0233.wav|to this fraudulent instrument he appended forged signatures, and in due course obtained probate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0234.wav|as he possessed nearly unbounded influence over his mother, her accession to the property meant that william could dispose of it as he pleased.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0235.wav|he embarked forthwith in a career of the wildest extravagance, and ere long he had parted in his mother's name with most of the landed estates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0236.wav|one large item of his expenditure was a contested election at lambeth, which he gained at a cost of ten thousand pounds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0237.wav|no fortune could stand the inroads he made into his mother's money,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0238.wav|and in eighteen sixty two he was obliged to fly the country, hopelessly and irretrievably ruined.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0239.wav|his disappearance gave color and substance to evil reports already in circulation that the will and conveyance above referred to
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0240.wav|were fictitious documents. his next brother, who should have inherited under the authentic will,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0241.wav|forthwith brought an ejectment on the possessor of lands purchased on the authority of the forged conveyance and will.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0242.wav|the case was tried at guildford assizes, and caused intense excitement,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0243.wav|the hardship to the holders of these lands being plain, should the allegations of invalidity be made good.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0244.wav|the effect of establishing the forgeries would be to restore to the roupell family lands for which a price had already been paid
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0245.wav|in all good faith to another, but a criminal member of the family.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0246.wav|at first the case was contested hotly, but, to the profound astonishment of every one inside and outside the court,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0247.wav|william roupell himself was brought as a principal witness to clench the case by a confession altogether against himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0248.wav|he told his story with perfect coolness and self possession, but in a grave and serious tone.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0249.wav|every word he uttered was said with consideration, and sometimes with a long pause,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0250.wav|but at the same time with an air of the most entire truthfulness and candor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0251.wav|he confessed himself a perjurer in having sworn to the false will, and a wholesale forger, having manufactured no less than ten false signatures
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0252.wav|to deeds involving on the whole some three hundred fifty thousand pounds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0253.wav|for these crimes william roupell was tried at the central criminal court on the twenty fourth september, eighteen sixty two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0254.wav|he declined to plead, but a plea of "not guilty" was recorded.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0255.wav|the case was easily and rapidly disposed of.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0256.wav|roupell made a long statement more in exculpation than in his defense.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0257.wav|he complained that he had at first been the dupe of others, and admitted that he had too readily fallen astray.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0258.wav|but while repudiating the charges made against him of systematic extravagance and immorality,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0259.wav|he confessed that his whole life had been a gigantic mistake, and he was ready to make what atonement he could.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0260.wav|mister justice byles, in passing sentence, commented severely upon the commission of such crimes by a man in roupell's position in life,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0261.wav|and passed the heaviest sentence of the law, transportation for life.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0262.wav|roupell received the announcement with a cheerful countenance,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0263.wav|and left the dock with evident satisfaction and relief at the termination of a most painful ordeal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0264.wav|roupell was quiet and submissive while in newgate, unassuming in manner, and ready to make the best of his position.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0265.wav|he carried this character with him into penal servitude, and after enduring the full severity of his punishment for several years,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0266.wav|was at length advanced to the comparative ease of a post much coveted by convicts, that of hospital nurse.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0267.wav|his uniform good conduct gained him release from portland on ticket of leave in eighteen eighty two, just twenty years after his conviction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0268.wav|a daring and cleverly planned robbery of diamonds was that of the tarpeys, man and wife,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0269.wav|from an assistant of loudon and ryder's, the jewelers in bond street. the trick was an old one.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0270.wav|the assistant called with the jewels on approbation at a house specially hired for the purpose in the west end,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0271.wav|and was rendered insensible by chloroform, after which he was bound and the precious stones stolen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0272.wav|misses tarpey was almost immediately captured and put on her trial, but she was acquitted on the plea that she had acted under the coercion of her husband.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0273.wav|tarpey was caught through his wife,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0274.wav|who was followed, disguised, and with her hair dyed black, to a house in the marylebone road, where she met her husband.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0275.wav|on tarpey's defense it was stated that the idea of the theft had been suggested to him by a novel, at a time he had lost largely on the turf.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0276.wav|the first plot was against mister harry emmanuel, but he escaped, and the attempt was made upon loudon and ryder.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0278.wav|this was the well and astutely devised plot of the brothers bidwell,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0279.wav|assisted by macdonell and noyes, all of them citizens of the united states, by which the bank lost upwards of one hundred thousand pounds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0280.wav|the commercial experience of these clever rogues was cosmopolitan.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0281.wav|their operations were no less worldwide.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0282.wav|in eighteen seventy one they crossed the atlantic,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0283.wav|and by means of forged letters of credit and introduction from london, obtained large sums from continental banks, in berlin,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0284.wav|dresden, bordeaux, marseilles, and lyons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0285.wav|with this as capital they came back to england via buenos aires,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0286.wav|and austin bidwell opened a bona fide credit in the burlington or west end branch of the bank of england,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0287.wav|to which he was introduced by a well known tailor in saville row.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0288.wav|after this the other conspirators traveled to obtain genuine bills and master the system of the leading houses at home and abroad.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0289.wav|when all was ready, bidwell first "refreshed his credit" at the bank of england, as well as disarmed suspicion,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0290.wav|by paying in a genuine bill of messrs. rothschilds' for forty five hundred pounds, which was duly discounted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0291.wav|then he explained to the bank manager
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0292.wav|that his transactions at birmingham would shortly be very large, owing to the development of his business there in the alleged manufacture of pullman cars.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0293.wav|the ground thus cleared, the forgers poured in from birmingham numbers of forged acceptances,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0294.wav|all of which were discounted to the value of one hundred two thousand, two hundred seventeen pounds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0295.wav|the fraud was rendered possible by the absence of a check usual in the united states.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0296.wav|there such bills would be sent to the drawer to be initialed, and the forgery would have been at once detected.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0297.wav|it was the discovery of this flaw in the banking system which had encouraged the americans to attempt this crime.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0298.wav|time was clearly an important factor in the fraud, hence the bills were sent forward in quick succession.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0299.wav|long before they came to maturity the forgers hoped to be well beyond arrest. they had, moreover, sought to destroy all clue.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0300.wav|the sums obtained by bidwell in the name of "warren" at the bank of england
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0301.wav|were lodged at once by drafts to "horton," another alias, in the continental bank.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0302.wav|for these cash was obtained in notes; the notes were exchanged by one of the conspirators for gold at the bank of england, and again the same day
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0303.wav|a second conspirator exchanged the gold for notes. but just as all promised well, the frauds were detected through the carelessness of the forgers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0304.wav|they had omitted to insert the dates in certain bills.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0305.wav|the bills were sent as a matter of form to the drawer to have the date added, and the forgery was at once detected.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0306.wav|noyes was seized without difficulty, as it was a part of the scheme that he should act as the dupe, and remain on the spot in london till all the money was obtained.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0307.wav|through noyes the rest of the conspirators were eventually apprehended. very little if any of the ill gotten proceeds, however, was ever recovered.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0308.wav|large sums, as they were realized, were transmitted to the united states, and invested in various american securities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0309.wav|where probably the money still remains.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0310.wav|the prisoners, who were committed to newgate for trial,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0311.wav|had undoubtedly the command of large funds while there, and would have readily disbursed it to effect their enlargement.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0312.wav|a plot was soon discovered,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0313.wav|deep laid, and with many ramifications, by which some of the newgate warders were to be bribed to allow the prisoners to escape from their cells at night.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0314.wav|certain friends of the prisoners were watched, and found to be in communication with these warders,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0315.wav|to whom it was said one hundred pounds apiece had been given down as the price of their infidelity.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0316.wav|further sums were to have been paid after the escape;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0317.wav|and one warder admitted that he was to have one thousand pounds more paid to him, and to be provided with a passage to australia.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0318.wav|the vigilance of the newgate officials, assisted by the city police, completely frustrated this plot.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0319.wav|a second was nevertheless set on foot,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0320.wav|in which the plan of action was changed, and the freedom of the prisoners was to be obtained by means of a rescue from the dock during the trial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0321.wav|an increase of policemen on duty sufficed to prevent any attempt of this kind.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0322.wav|nor were these two abortive efforts all that were planned.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0323.wav|a year or two after, when the prisoners were undergoing their life sentences of penal servitude,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0324.wav|much uneasiness was caused at one of the convict prisons by information that bribery on a large scale was again at work amongst the officials.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0325.wav|but extra precautions and close supervision have so far proved effectual, and the prisoners are still in custody after a lapse of ten years.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0329.wav|their crimes follow in the lines of others already found, and often more than once, in the calendars.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0330.wav|violent passions too easily aroused prompted the frenchwoman marguerite dixblanc
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0331.wav|to murder her mistress, madame riel, in park lane, as courvoisier, the swiss, had been tempted to murder lord william russell.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0333.wav|it was the principal incentive with kate webster, that fierce and brutal female savage who took the life of her mistress at richmond.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0334.wav|webster, it may be mentioned here, was one of the worst prisoners ever remembered in newgate

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0340.wav|characterized this as a crime more black and hideous than any in the criminal annals of the country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ018-0341.wav|but it was scarcely worse than that of misses brownrigg, or that of the meteyards, both of whom did their helpless apprentices to death.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0051.wav|the other supported the theory of labor in association, but under a stringent rule of silence, with isolation only at night.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0056.wav|colonel jebb preferred it; messrs. crawford and whitworth russell were convinced that the complete isolation of criminals from one another

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0061.wav|another argument was, that it afforded more hope of the reformation of criminals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0062.wav|the system of associated labor in silence had also its warm supporters,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0063.wav|who maintained that under this system prisoners were more industrious and more healthy
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0064.wav|that their condition was more natural, and approximated more nearly to that of daily life.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0080.wav|some were not sufficiently ventilated, others were warmed artificially, and were unwholesomely close.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0083.wav|the discipline also varied greatly, from the severely penal to the culpably lax.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0085.wav|the prisoners might be supervised and watched at every step, and made liable to punishment for a trifling breach of an irksome code of regulations,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0088.wav|there was no general rule of employment. hard labor was often not insisted upon in separate confinement;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0089.wav|sometimes it embraced the tread wheel or the newly invented instruments known as cranks, which ground air.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0091.wav|were mere matters of chance, and decided according to the views of the local magistracy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0092.wav|they were approved of and employed at some prisons, at others objected to because they were unproductive,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0093.wav|and because the machine was often so imperfect that the amount of effort could not be exactly regulated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0094.wav|opinions differed greatly with regard to the tread wheel; some authorities advocated it as a very severe and irksome punishment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0095.wav|which was yet under full control, and might be made to work corn mills or prove otherwise productive;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0096.wav|other authorities as strongly condemned it as brutalizing, unequal in its operation, and altogether a "deplorable invention."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0097.wav|this want of uniformity in prison discipline became ere long an acknowledged evil pressing for some remedy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0098.wav|and the question was once more taken up in the house of commons. in eighteen forty nine mister charles pearson, m.p.,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0099.wav|moved for a committee to report upon the best means of securing some uniform system which should be "punitive, reformatory, and self supporting;"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0100.wav|but the session was far advanced, and the matter was relegated to the following year.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0101.wav|in eighteen fifty sir george grey brought forward a new motion to the same effect,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0102.wav|which was promptly carried, with the additional instruction to the committee to suggest any improvements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0103.wav|the latter had reference more especially to a proposal emanating from mister charles pearson himself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0104.wav|that gentleman had come to the conclusion that the ordinary and hackneyed methods of treatment were practically inefficacious,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0105.wav|and that a new system of prison discipline should be introduced.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0106.wav|his plan was to devote the whole labor of prisoners sentenced to any term between three months and four years to agriculture.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0107.wav|district prisons were to be established for this purpose, each of which would be in the heart of a farm of a thousand acres.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0108.wav|the prisoners were to cultivate the land and raise sufficient produce for their own support.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0109.wav|mister pearson backed up his recommendations by many sound arguments.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0110.wav|field labor, he urged, and with reason, was a very suitable employment;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0111.wav|healthful, easily learnt, and well adapted to the circumstances of unskilled laborers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0112.wav|such excellent returns might be counted upon, that a margin of profit would be left after the cost of the prisons had been defrayed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0113.wav|the scheme was no doubt fascinating, and in many respects feasible;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0114.wav|but mister pearson overlooked some points in which a more practical mind would have foreseen difficulty, and perhaps forecasted failure.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0115.wav|in his proposal he dwelt much upon the humanizing effects of healthful open air toil,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0116.wav|anticipating the best results from a system which made earnings, and indeed release, dependent upon the amount of work done.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0117.wav|that industry might thus be stimulated and encouraged was probable enough,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0118.wav|and later experience has fully proved the advantage of a judicious system of gratuities for labor;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0119.wav|but mister pearson hardly considered the converse sufficiently, and
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0120.wav|omitted the fact that he might have to deal with that persistent idleness which is not an unknown characteristic of the criminal class.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0121.wav|the hope of reward might do much, but no system of penal discipline is complete unless it can also count upon the fear of punishment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0122.wav|mister pearson seems to have taken for granted that all prisoners would behave well in his district prisons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0123.wav|on that account he made no provision to insure safe custody,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0124.wav|thinking perhaps that prisoners so well disposed would cheerfully remain in jail of their own accord.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0125.wav|but an open farm of a thousand acres would have offered abundant chances of escape, which some at least would have attempted, probably with success.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0126.wav|the creation of an expensive staff for supervision,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0127.wav|or the still more costly process of walling in the whole farm, would have greatly added to the charges of these establishments.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0128.wav|i have lingered too long perhaps over mister pearson's proposal, but some reference was indispensable to a scheme
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0129.wav|which marked the growth of public interest in prison affairs, and which was the germ of the new system
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0130.wav|since admirably developed in the convict prisons of this country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0131.wav|mister pearson and the committee of eighteen fifty have the more claim on our consideration, because,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0132.wav|in the inquiry which followed, attention was again attracted to newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0133.wav|the condition of that prison in eighteen fifty may be gathered from the pages of the report. not much had been done to remedy the old defects;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0134.wav|radical improvement was generally considered impossible. the great evil, however, had been sensibly diminished.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0135.wav|there was no longer, or at worst but rarely, and for short periods, the same overcrowding.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0136.wav|this was obviated by the frequent sessions of the central criminal court, and the utilization of the two subsidiary prisons in giltspur street and southwark.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0137.wav|the prison population of newgate was still subject to great fluctuations, but it seldom rose above two hundred and fifty or three hundred
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0138.wav|at the most crowded periods, or just before the sessional jail delivery; and at its lowest it fell sometimes to fifty or sixty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0139.wav|these numbers would have still further decreased, and the jail would have been almost empty, but for the misdemeanants who were still sent to newgate
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0140.wav|at times on long terms of imprisonment, and for the transports, whom the home office were often, as of old, slow to remove.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0141.wav|the old wards, day rooms and sleeping rooms combined, of which the reader has already heard so much,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0142.wav|now seldom contained more than ten or a dozen each. some sort of decorum was maintained among the occupants in the day time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0143.wav|drinking and gaming,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0144.wav|the indiscriminate visitation of friends, and the almost unlimited admission of extra food, these more glaring defects had disappeared.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0145.wav|but reformation was only skin deep. below the surface many of the old evils still rankled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0146.wav|there was as yet no control over the prisoners after locking up time;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0147.wav|this occurred in summer at eight, but in the winter months it took place at dusk, and was often as early as four or five.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0148.wav|the prisoners were still left to themselves till next morning's unlocking,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0149.wav|and they spent some fourteen or fifteen hours in total darkness, and almost without check or control.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0150.wav|captain williams, who was the inspector of prisons for the home district in succession to messrs. crawford and russell,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0151.wav|stated in evidence that he was visiting newgate one night, when he heard a great disturbance in one of the day and sleeping rooms,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0152.wav|and on entering it found the prisoners engaged in kicking bundles of wood from one end of the ward to the other.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0153.wav|some attempt at supervision was exercised by the night watchman stationed on the leads, who might hear what went on inside.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0154.wav|if any disturbance reached his ears, he reported the case to the governor, who next morning visited the ward in fault, and asked for the culprit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0155.wav|the enforcement of discipline depended upon the want of honor among thieves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0156.wav|unless the guilty prisoner was given up, the whole ward was punished, either by the exclusion of visitors or the deprivation of fire,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0157.wav|sharp tests which generally broke down the fidelity of the inmates of the ward to one another.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0158.wav|later on a more efficacious but still imperfect method of supervision was introduced. iron cages, which are still to be seen in newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0159.wav|were constructed on the landings, ensconced in which warders spent the night, on duty, and alert to watch the sleepers below,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0160.wav|and check by remonstrance or threat of punishment all who broke the peace of the prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0161.wav|these disciplinary improvements were, however, only slowly and gradually introduced.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0162.wav|other changes affecting the condition and proper treatment of prisoners were not made until the inspector had urged and recommended them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0163.wav|thus the wards, which, as i have said, were left in complete darkness, were now to be lighted with gas; and after this most salutary addition,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0164.wav|the personal superintendence of night officers, as already described, became possible.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0165.wav|the rule became general as regards the prison dress; hitherto clothing had been issued only to such as were destitute or in rags, and all classes of prisoners,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0166.wav|those for trial, and those sentenced for short terms or long
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0167.wav|wore no distinguishing costume, although its use was admitted, not only for cleanliness, but as a badge of condition, and a security against escape.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0168.wav|renewed recommendations to provide employment resulted in the provision of a certain amount of oakum for picking,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0169.wav|and one or two men were allowed to mend clothes and make shoes. the rules made by the secretary of state were hung up in conspicuous parts of the prison;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0170.wav|more officers were appointed, as the time of so many of those already on the staff was monopolized by attendance at the central criminal court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0171.wav|another custom which had led to disorder was abolished;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0172.wav|prisoners who had been acquitted were not permitted to return to the prison to show their joy and receive the congratulations of their unfortunate fellows.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0173.wav|the corporation seems to have introduced these salutary changes without hesitation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0174.wav|it was less prompt apparently in dealing with structural alterations and improvements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0175.wav|well founded complaints had been made of the want of heating appliances in the jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0176.wav|the wards had open fires, but the separate cells were not warmed at all.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0177.wav|a scheme for heating the whole prison with hot water pipes, after the system now generally adopted elsewhere, was considered,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0178.wav|and abandoned because of the expense. as to the entire reconstruction of newgate, nothing had been done as yet.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0179.wav|this, with a scheme for limiting the jail to untried prisoners, had been urgently recommended by lord john russell in eighteen thirty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0180.wav|his letter to the corporation, under date fourth june,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0181.wav|is an interesting document, and shows that even at that date the government contemplated the erection of a model prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0182.wav|lord john russell, commenting upon the offer of the corporation to improve newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0183.wav|provided it was henceforth used only for untried prisoners, suggested that newgate should be entirely reconstructed, and the new building adopted as a model.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0184.wav|the corporation had agreed to spend twenty thousand pounds on alterations, but sixty thousand pounds would suffice to reconstruct.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0185.wav|lord john, with great fairness, admitted that the whole of this burthen could not be imposed upon the city
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0186.wav|seeing that since the establishment of the central criminal court, newgate received prisoners for trial from several counties,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0187.wav|and he was therefore prepared to submit to parliament a proposal that half the cost of reconstruction should be borne by public funds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0188.wav|he forwarded plans prepared by the inspectors of prisons, not for blind adoption, but as a guide.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0189.wav|this plan was on the principle of cellular separation, a system, according to lord john russell, desirable in all prisons,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0190.wav|"but in a metropolitan prison absolutely essential." the corporation in reply demurred rather to accepting strict separation as a rule,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0191.wav|feeling that it approached too nearly to solitary confinement.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0192.wav|the court was, however, prepared to consider lord john russell's proposal with regard to the cost of rebuilding;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0193.wav|but as the plan was "confessedly experimental, for the benefit of the country generally, the amount for which the city should be responsible should be distinctly limited
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0194.wav|not to exceed a certain sum to be agreed upon.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0195.wav|a proviso was also made that the magistrates should continue to exercise full control over the new jail,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0196.wav|free from any other interference than that of the inspectors on the part of government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0197.wav|no doubt wiser counsels prevailed with lord john russell,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0198.wav|and on a more mature consideration he realized that the limited area of the existing newgate site,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0199.wav|and the costliness of enlarging it, forbade all idea of entirely reconstructing the jail so as to constitute it a model prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0200.wav|it would be far better to begin at the beginning,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0201.wav|to select a sufficiently spacious piece of ground, and erect a prison which from foundations to roofs should be in conformity with the newest ideas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0202.wav|the preference given to the pentonville system destroyed all hopes of a complete reformation of newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0203.wav|but the condition of the great city jail was evidently considered a reproach by the city authorities, and a year after the opening of the new "model" at pentonville,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0204.wav|a serious effort was made to reconstruct newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0205.wav|in eighteen forty five the jail committee brought forward a definite proposal to purchase ground in the immediate vicinity for the erection of a new jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0206.wav|this jail was nominally to replace the giltspur street compter,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0207.wav|the site of which was to be sold to christ's hospital, but the intention was of course to embody and absorb old newgate in the new construction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0208.wav|the proposal made was to purchase some fifty thousand square feet between newgate, warwick lane, and the sessions house,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0209.wav|the situation having been proved by long experience to be salubrious.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0210.wav|but when this suggestion was brought before the court of aldermen, various amendments were proposed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0211.wav|it was urged that the area selected for purchase must be excessively costly to acquire, and still quite inadequate for the city needs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0212.wav|the home secretary had laid it down that at least five acres would be indispensable, and such an area it was impossible to obtain within the limits of the city.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0214.wav|the corporation owned lands there covering from nineteen to twenty acres.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0215.wav|why not move the city prison bodily into this more rural spot, with its purer air and greater breathing space?

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0220.wav|the uses of newgate were narrowed almost entirely to those of a prison of detention.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0221.wav|it was intended as far as possible that, except awaiting trial, no prisoner should find himself relegated to newgate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0222.wav|this principle became more and more generally the rule, although it has never been punctiliously observed. now and again
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0223.wav|misdemeanants have found their way into newgate, and within the last few years one offender against the privileges of the house of commons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0224.wav|with the reduction of numbers to be accommodated, there was ample space in newgate for its reconstruction on the most approved modern lines.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0225.wav|in eighteen fifty seven
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0226.wav|the erection of a wing or large block of cells was commenced within the original walls of the prison, and upon the north or male side.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0227.wav|this block contained one hundred and thirty cells, embracing every modern improvement;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0228.wav|it also contained eleven reception cells, six punishment cells, and a couple of cells for condemned criminals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0229.wav|this block was completed in eighteen fifty nine, after which the hitherto unavoidable and long continued promiscuous association of prisoners
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0230.wav|in eighteen sixty one a similar work was undertaken to provide separate cellular accommodation for the female inmates of newgate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0231.wav|and by the following year forty seven new cells had been built on the most approved plan.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0232.wav|during this reconstruction the female prisoners were lodged in holloway,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0233.wav|and when it was completed, both sides of the prison were brought into harmony with modern ideas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0234.wav|the old buildings were entirely disused, and the whole of the inmates of newgate were kept constantly in separate confinement.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0235.wav|with the last re edification of newgate, a work executed some seven centuries after the first stone of the old jail was laid,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0237.wav|the act for private executions led to the erection of the gallows shed in the exercising yard, and at the flank of the passage from the condemned cells.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0238.wav|the first "glass house," or room in which prisoners could talk in private with their attorneys, but yet be seen by the warder on the watch, had been constructed
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0239.wav|and others were subsequently added.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0240.wav|but no structural alterations were made from the date first quoted until the time of closing the prison in eighteen eighty one.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0241.wav|but in the interval very comprehensive and, i think it must be admitted, salutary changes were successively introduced into the management of prisons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0242.wav|newgate naturally shared in any advantages due to these reforms. i propose, therefore, to refer to them in the concluding pages of this work,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0243.wav|and thus bring the history of prison discipline down to our own times.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0244.wav|the last inquiry into the condition and management of our jails and houses of correction was that made by the lords' committee in eighteen sixty three.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0245.wav|the inquiry was most searching and complete, and the committee spoke plainly in its report.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0246.wav|it animadverted strongly on "the many and wide differences as regards construction, labor, diet, and general discipline"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0247.wav|which existed in the various prisons,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0248.wav|leading to an inequality, uncertainty, and inefficiency of punishment productive of the most prejudicial results.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0249.wav|the varieties in construction were still very marked.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0250.wav|in many prisons the prisoners were still associated, and, from the want of a sufficient number of cells, the principle of separation was still greatly neglected.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0251.wav|yet this principle, as the committee pointed out, "must now be accepted as the foundation of prison discipline,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0252.wav|while its rigid maintenance was in its opinion vital to the efficiency of the jails.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0253.wav|even where cells had been built
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0254.wav|they were frequently below the standard size, and were therefore not certified for occupation as was required by law.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0255.wav|great numbers were not lighted at night, and were without means by which their inmates could communicate, in case of urgent necessity, with their keepers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0256.wav|still greater were the differences with regard to employment. the various authorities held widely different opinions as to what constituted hard labor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0257.wav|here the tread wheel was in use, there cellular cranks, or hard labor machines.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0258.wav|both, however, varied greatly in mechanism and in the amount of energy they called forth,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0259.wav|while the former was intended for the congregate labor of a number, and the latter, as its name implies, imposed continuous solitary toil.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0260.wav|at other prisons "shot drill," the lifting and carrying of heavy round shot, was the favorite method of inflicting penal labor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0261.wav|with these differences were others as opposed concerning industrial occupation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0262.wav|the jail authorities often gave the highest, possibly undue, importance to the value of remunerative employment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0263.wav|and sought to make profitable returns from prisoners' labor the test of prison efficiency. in this view the committee could not coincide,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0264.wav|and it was decidedly of opinion that in all short sentences the hard labor of the tread wheel, crank, and so forth should be the invariable rule.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0265.wav|in dietaries, again, the same wide diversity of practice obtained.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0266.wav|the efforts made by sir james graham years before to introduce uniformity in this particular had failed of effect.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0267.wav|the secretary of state's suggested scale of diet had seldom been closely followed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0268.wav|in some places the dietary was too full, in others too meager. its constituents were not of the most suitable character.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0269.wav|more animal food was given than was necessary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0270.wav|vegetables, especially the potato, that most valuable anti scorbutic, was too often omitted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0271.wav|in a word, the value of diet as a part of penal discipline was still insufficiently recognized.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0272.wav|the prisons were still far from inflicting the three punishments, hard labor, hard fare, and a hard bed
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0273.wav|which sir joshua jebb told the committee he considered the proper elements of penal discipline.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0274.wav|it is interesting to note here
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0275.wav|that the committee of eighteen sixty three fully endorsed sir joshua's recommendations as regards a "hard bed," and recommended that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0276.wav|during short sentences, or the earlier stages of a long confinement,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0277.wav|the prisoners should be made to dispense with the use of a mattress, and should sleep on planks.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0278.wav|this suggestion was adopted in the act of eighteen sixty five, which followed the committee's report, and of which more directly.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0279.wav|clause ninety two, schedule one of that act authorized the use of plank beds, which were adopted in many prisons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0280.wav|they are now the universal rule,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0281.wav|introduced, as was erroneously supposed, by the prison commissioners appointed under the prison act of eighteen seventy seven.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0282.wav|their origin it will be seen dates back much further than that.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0283.wav|beds might well be made hard and their use strictly limited.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0284.wav|according to this committee of eighteen sixty three, beds in the smaller and most carelessly conducted prisons formed a large element in the life of a prisoner.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0285.wav|in one jail fifteen hours were spent in bed out of the twenty four. this was in keeping with other grave defects and omissions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0286.wav|the minor borough prisons were the worst blot on the still dark and imperfect system.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0287.wav|they were very numerous, very imperfect in construction and management, and they were very little required.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0288.wav|in them, according to the committee, the old objectionable practices were still in full force.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0289.wav|there was unrestrained association of untried and convicted, juvenile with adult prisoners, vagrants, misdemeanants, felons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0290.wav|there were dormitories without light, control, or regulation at night,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0291.wav|which warders, dreading assault, were afraid to enter after dark, even to check rioting and disturbance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0292.wav|prisoners still slept two in a bed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0293.wav|in one prison the bedsteads had been removed lest the prisoners should break them up and convert them into weapons of offense.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0294.wav|the prison buildings were in many places out of repair; other houses often overlooked them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0295.wav|a single officer was the only custodian and disciplinary authority in the jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0296.wav|complete idleness was tolerated; there was neither penal labor nor light employment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0297.wav|the prisoners inter communicated freely, and exercised the most injurious, corrupting influences upon one another.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0298.wav|the total want of administration was very marked,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0299.wav|but in one prison it was such that the prisoners' food was supplied daily from the neighboring inn, and the innkeeper's bill constituted the only accounts kept.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0300.wav|the committee might well suggest the abolition of these jails, or their amalgamation with the larger county establishments in their immediate neighborhood.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0301.wav|some idea of the comparative uselessness of these small borough prisons was conveyed by some figures quoted by the committee.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0302.wav|in eighteen sixty two there were in all one hundred and ninety three jails in england and wales;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0303.wav|of these, sixty three gave admittance during the entire year to less than twenty five prisoners;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0304.wav|twenty two others received between eleven and twenty five;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0305.wav|fourteen received less than eleven and more than six;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0306.wav|while twenty seven received less than six prisoners, and were in some instances absolutely tenantless.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0307.wav|the result of the recommendation of the committee of eighteen sixty two was the prison act of eighteen sixty five,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0308.wav|the penultimate of such enactments, many of the provisions of which still remain in force.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0309.wav|the main object of this act was to compass that uniformity in discipline and treatment generally
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0310.wav|which had long been admitted as indispensable, and had never as yet been properly obtained.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0311.wav|the legislature was beginning to overcome its disinclination to interfere actively or authoritatively
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0312.wav|with the local jurisdictions, although still very leniently disposed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0313.wav|however, it now laid down in plain language and with precise details the requirements of a good jail system.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0314.wav|the separation of prisoners in cells duly certified by the inspectors was insisted upon,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0315.wav|also their constant employment in labor appropriate to their condition.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0316.wav|hard labor of the first and second class was carefully defined.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0317.wav|the former, which consisted principally of the tread wheel, cranks, capstans, shot drill,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0318.wav|was to be the rule for all convicted prisoners throughout the early stages of their detention;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0319.wav|while the latter, which included various forms of industrial employment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0320.wav|was the boon to which willing industry extending over a long period established a certain claim.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0321.wav|the infliction of punishment more or less uniform was thus aimed at.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0322.wav|on the other hand, new and careful regulations were framed to secure the moral and material well being of the inmates of the jails.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0323.wav|the law made it imperative that every prison should have a prison chapel, and that daily and sunday services should be held.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0324.wav|the chaplain's duties were enlarged, and the principle of toleration accepted to the extent of securing to all prisoners
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0325.wav|the ministrations of ministers of their own form of belief.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0326.wav|steps were taken to provide the illiterate with secular instruction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0327.wav|no less close was the care as regards preservation of health.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0328.wav|stringent rules were prescribed for the prison surgeons;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0329.wav|every prison was ordered to keep up an infirmary, and the medical supervision was to be strict and continuous.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0330.wav|dietaries were drawn up for adoption on the recommendation of a committee of experts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0331.wav|baths were provided, ablutions ordered, and all appliances to insure personal cleanliness.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0332.wav|the administration of good government was to be watched over by the local magistracy, certain of whom, styled visiting justices,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0333.wav|were elected to inspect the prisons frequently, to examine the prisoners, hear complaints, and check abuses.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0334.wav|under them the governor or jailer was held strictly responsible.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0335.wav|the books and journals he was to keep were minutely specified, and his constant presence in or near the jail was insisted upon.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0336.wav|his disciplinary powers were defined by the act, and his duties,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0337.wav|both in controlling his subordinates and in protecting the prisoners from petty tyranny and oppression, every one of whom he was to see once every twenty four hours.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0338.wav|but discipline was to be maintained if necessary by punishment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0339.wav|while decency and good order were to be insured by the strict prohibition of gambling and drunkenness.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0340.wav|the latter was rendered nearly impossible by the penalties imposed on persons bringing spirituous liquors into the jail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0341.wav|the old custom, so fruitful of the worst evils, of keeping a tap inside the prison was made illegal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0342.wav|so was the employment of prisoners in any position of trust or authority;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0343.wav|they were not to be turnkeys or assistant turnkeys, neither wardsman nor yardsman, overseer,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0344.wav|monitor, or schoolmaster, nor to be engaged in the service of any officer of the prison.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0345.wav|the act of eighteen sixty five also encouraged and empowered the local authorities to "alter, enlarge, or rebuild" their prisons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0346.wav|they might raise funds for this purpose, provided a certificate for the necessity for the new works was given, either by the recorder
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0347.wav|chairman of quarter sessions, or even by a couple of justices.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0348.wav|every facility was promised. the sanction of the secretary of state would not be withheld if plans and estimates were duly submitted,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0349.wav|and they met with the approval of his professional adviser, the surveyor general of prisons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0350.wav|the funds necessary would be advanced by the public works loan commissioners, and the interest might be charged against the county or borough rates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0351.wav|nor were these the only inducements offered. where local authorities were indisposed to set their prisons in order,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0352.wav|or hesitated to embark upon any considerable expenditure to alter or rebuild,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0353.wav|they were at liberty to hire suitable cell accommodation from any neighbors who might have it to spare; the only proviso,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0354.wav|that no such contract was valid between one jurisdiction and another unless the secretary of state was satisfied that the prison it was intended to use
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0355.wav|came up in all respects to modern requirements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0356.wav|but the act was not limited to permissive legislation. its provisions and enactments were backed up by certain penalties.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ019-0357.wav|the secretary of state was empowered to deal rather summarily with "inadequate" prisons, in other words,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0018.wav|the tremendous power of organization has combined great aggregations of capital in enormous industrial establishments

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0020.wav|and transportation and trade, so great in the mass that each individual concerned in them is quite helpless by himself.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0022.wav|between the small producer, the small trader, the consumer,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0023.wav|and the great transporting and manufacturing and distributing agencies,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0024.wav|all present new questions for the solution of which the old reliance upon the free action of individual wills appears quite inadequate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0025.wav|and in many directions, the intervention of that organized control which we call government
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0026.wav|seems necessary to produce the same result of justice and right conduct
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0027.wav|which obtained through the attrition of individuals before the new conditions arose.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0028.wav|it was in this spirit thus described by secretary root
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0029.wav|that we approached our task of reviving private enterprise in march, nineteen thirty three.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0030.wav|our first problem was, of course, the banking situation because, as you know, the banks had collapsed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0031.wav|some banks could not be saved but the great majority of them, either through their own resources or with government aid,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0032.wav|have been restored to complete public confidence.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0033.wav|this has given safety to millions of depositors in these banks.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0034.wav|closely following this great constructive effort we have, through various federal agencies,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0035.wav|saved debtors and creditors alike in many other fields of enterprise, such as loans on farm mortgages and home mortgages;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0036.wav|loans to the railroads and insurance companies and, finally, help for home owners and industry itself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0037.wav|in all of these efforts the government has come to the assistance of business
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0038.wav|and with the full expectation that the money used to assist these enterprises will eventually be repaid.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0039.wav|i believe it will be.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0040.wav|the second step we have taken in the restoration of normal business enterprise
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0041.wav|has been to clean up thoroughly unwholesome conditions in the field of investment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0042.wav|in this we have had assistance from many bankers and businessmen,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0043.wav|most of whom recognize the past evils in the banking system, in the sale of securities, in the deliberate encouragement of stock gambling,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0044.wav|in the sale of unsound mortgages and in many other ways in which the public lost billions of dollars.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0046.wav|there could be no recovery of public confidence in the security of savings.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0047.wav|the country now enjoys the safety of bank savings under the new banking laws,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0055.wav|in meeting the problems of industrial recovery the chief agency of the government has been the national recovery administration.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0056.wav|under its guidance, trades and industries covering over ninety percent of all industrial employees
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0057.wav|have adopted codes of fair competition, which have been approved by the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0058.wav|under these codes, in the industries covered, child labor has been eliminated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0059.wav|the work day and the work week have been shortened.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0060.wav|minimum wages have been established and other wages adjusted toward a rising standard of living.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0061.wav|the emergency purpose of the n.r.a. was to put men to work and since its creation more than four million persons have been reemployed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0062.wav|in great part through the cooperation of american business brought about under the codes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0063.wav|benefits of the industrial recovery program have come,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0064.wav|not only to labor in the form of new jobs, in relief from overwork and in relief from underpay,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0065.wav|but also to the owners and managers of industry because,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0066.wav|together with a great increase in the payrolls, there has come a substantial rise in the total of industrial profits
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0067.wav|a rise from a deficit figure in the first quarter of nineteen thirty three
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0068.wav|to a level of sustained profits within one year from the inauguration of n.r.a.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0069.wav|now it should not be expected that even employed labor and capital would be completely satisfied with present conditions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0070.wav|employed workers have not by any means all enjoyed a return to the earnings of prosperous times,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0071.wav|although millions of hitherto underprivileged workers are today far better paid than ever before.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0072.wav|also, billions of dollars of invested capital have today a greater security of present and future earning power than before.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0073.wav|this is because of the establishment of fair, competitive standards and because of relief from unfair competition
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0074.wav|in wage cutting which depresses markets and destroys purchasing power.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0075.wav|but it is an undeniable fact that the restoration of other billions of sound investments to a reasonable earning power
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0076.wav|could not be brought about in one year.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0077.wav|there is no magic formula,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0078.wav|no economic panacea, which could simply revive over night the heavy industries and the trades dependent upon them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0079.wav|nevertheless the gains of trade and industry, as a whole, have been substantial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0080.wav|in these gains and in the policies of the administration there are assurances that hearten all forward looking men and women

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0083.wav|which americans have demanded since the white man first came to these shores.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0084.wav|we count, in the future as in the past, on the driving power of individual initiative
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0085.wav|and the incentive of fair private profit,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0086.wav|strengthened with the acceptance of those obligations to the public interest which rest upon us all.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0087.wav|we have the right to expect that this driving power will be given patriotically and whole heartedly to our nation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0088.wav|we have passed through the formative period of code making in the national recovery administration
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0089.wav|and have effected a reorganization of the n.r.a.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0090.wav|suited to the needs of the next phase, which is, in turn, a period of preparation for legislation which will determine its permanent form.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0091.wav|in this recent reorganization we have recognized three distinct functions:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0092.wav|first, the legislative or policy making function;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0093.wav|second, the administrative function of code making and revision; and, third, the judicial function, which includes enforcement,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0094.wav|consumer complaints and the settlement of disputes between employers and employees and between one employer and another.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0095.wav|we are now prepared to move into this second phase, on the basis of our experience in the first phase
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0096.wav|under the able and energetic leadership of general johnson.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0097.wav|we shall watch carefully the working of this new machinery for the second phase of n.r.a.,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0098.wav|modifying it where it needs modification and finally making recommendations to the congress,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0099.wav|in order that the functions of n.r.a. which have proved their worth may be made a part of the permanent machinery of government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0100.wav|let me call your attention to the fact that the national industrial recovery act
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0101.wav|gave businessmen the opportunity they had sought for years to improve business conditions through what has been called self government in industry.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0102.wav|if the codes which have been written have been too complicated,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0103.wav|if they have gone too far in such matters as price fixing and limitation of production,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0104.wav|let it be remembered that so far as possible, consistent with the immediate public interest of this past year
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0105.wav|and the vital necessity of improving labor conditions,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0106.wav|the representatives of trade and industry were permitted to write their ideas into the codes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0107.wav|it is now time to review these actions as a whole to determine through deliberative means in the light of experience,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0108.wav|from the standpoint of the good of the industries themselves, as well as the general public interest,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0109.wav|whether the methods and policies adopted in the emergency
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0110.wav|have been best calculated to promote industrial recovery and a permanent improvement of business and labor conditions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0111.wav|there may be a serious question as to the wisdom of many of those devices to control production,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0112.wav|or to prevent destructive price cutting which many business organizations have insisted were necessary,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0113.wav|or whether their effect may have been to prevent that volume of production which would make possible lower prices and increased employment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0114.wav|another question arises as to whether in fixing minimum wages on the basis of an hourly or weekly wage
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0115.wav|we have reached into the heart of the problem which is to provide such annual earnings for the lowest paid worker as will meet his minimum needs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0116.wav|we also question the wisdom of extending code requirements suited to the great industrial centers and to large employers,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0117.wav|to the great number of small employers in the smaller communities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0118.wav|during the last twelve months our industrial recovery has been to some extent retarded by strikes,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0119.wav|including a few of major importance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0120.wav|i would not minimize the inevitable losses to employers and employees and to the general public through such conflicts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0121.wav|but i would point out that the extent and severity of labor disputes during this period
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0122.wav|has been far less than in any previous, comparable period.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0123.wav|when the businessmen of the country were demanding the right to organize themselves adequately to promote their legitimate interests;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0124.wav|when the farmers were demanding legislation which would give them opportunities and incentives to organize themselves for a common advance,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0125.wav|it was natural that the workers should seek and obtain a statutory declaration of their constitutional right
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0126.wav|to organize themselves for collective bargaining as embodied in section seven (a) of the national industrial recovery act.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0127.wav|machinery set up by the federal government has provided some new methods of adjustment.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ021-0139.wav|there should be at least a full and fair trial given to these means of ending industrial warfare;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0008.wav|each of our steps has a definite relationship to every other step.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0009.wav|the job of creating a program for the nation's welfare is, in some respects, like the building of a ship.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0014.wav|the creation of a useful instrument for man ultimately comes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0015.wav|it is that way with the making of a national policy. the objective of the nation has greatly changed in three years

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0029.wav|so many people come to washington who know things that are not so,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0038.wav|that makes it particularly necessary for the vice president and for me to conceive of our duty toward the entire country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0039.wav|i speak, therefore, tonight, to and of the american people as a whole.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0040.wav|my most immediate concern is in carrying out the purposes of the great work program just enacted by the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0041.wav|its first objective is to put men and women now on the relief rolls to work and, incidentally,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0042.wav|to assist materially in our already unmistakable march toward recovery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0043.wav|i shall not confuse my discussion by a multitude of figures. so many figures are quoted to prove so many things.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0044.wav|sometimes it depends upon what paper you read and what broadcast you hear.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0045.wav|therefore, let us keep our minds on two or three simple, essential facts in connection with this problem of unemployment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0046.wav|it is true that while business and industry are definitely better our relief rolls are still too large.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0047.wav|however, for the first time in five years the relief rolls have declined instead of increased during the winter months.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0048.wav|they are still declining.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0049.wav|the simple fact is that many million more people have private work today than two years ago today or one year ago today,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0050.wav|and every day that passes offers more chances to work for those who want to work.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0051.wav|in spite of the fact that unemployment remains a serious problem
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0052.wav|here as in every other nation, we have come to recognize the possibility and the necessity of certain helpful remedial measures.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0053.wav|these measures are of two kinds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0054.wav|the first is to make provisions intended to relieve, to minimize, and to prevent future unemployment;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0055.wav|the second is to establish the practical means to help those who are unemployed in this present emergency.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0056.wav|our social security legislation is an attempt to answer the first of these questions; our works relief program, the second.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0057.wav|the program for social security now pending before the congress is a necessary part of the future unemployment policy of the government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0058.wav|while our present and projected expenditures for work relief are wholly within the reasonable limits of our national credit resources,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0059.wav|it is obvious that we cannot continue to create governmental deficits for that purpose year after year.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0060.wav|we must begin now to make provision for the future.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0061.wav|that is why our social security program is an important part of the complete picture.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0062.wav|it proposes, by means of old age pensions,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0063.wav|to help those who have reached the age of retirement to give up their jobs and thus give to the younger generation greater opportunities for work
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0064.wav|and to give to all a feeling of security as they look toward old age.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0065.wav|the unemployment insurance part of the legislation
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0066.wav|will not only help to guard the individual in future periods of lay off against dependence upon relief,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0067.wav|but it will, by sustaining purchasing power, cushion the shock of economic distress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0068.wav|another helpful feature of unemployment insurance is the incentive it will give to employers to plan more carefully
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0069.wav|in order that unemployment may be prevented by the stabilizing of employment itself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0070.wav|provisions for social security, however, are protections for the future.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0072.wav|through the most comprehensive work plan in the history of the nation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0073.wav|our problem is to put to work three and one half million employable persons now on the relief rolls.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0074.wav|it is a problem quite as much for private industry as for the government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0075.wav|we are losing no time getting the government's vast work relief program underway,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0076.wav|and we have every reason to believe that it should be in full swing by autumn.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0077.wav|in directing it, i shall recognize six fundamental principles:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0078.wav|one. the projects should be useful.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0079.wav|projects shall be of a nature that a considerable proportion of the money spent will go into wages for labor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0080.wav|projects will be sought which promise ultimate return to the federal treasury of a considerable proportion of the costs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0081.wav|funds allotted for each project should be actually and promptly spent and not held over until later years.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0082.wav|in all cases projects must be of a character to give employment to those on the relief rolls.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0083.wav|six. projects will be allocated to localities or relief areas in relation to the number of workers on relief rolls in those areas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0084.wav|i next want to make it clear exactly how we shall direct the work.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0085.wav|i have set up a division of applications and information
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0086.wav|to which all proposals for the expenditure of money must go for preliminary study and consideration.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0087.wav|after the division of applications and information has sifted those projects,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0088.wav|they will be sent to an allotment division composed of representatives of the more important governmental agencies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0089.wav|charged with carrying on work relief projects.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0090.wav|the group will also include representatives of cities, and of labor, farming, banking and industry.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0091.wav|this allotment division will consider all of the recommendations submitted to it
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0092.wav|and such projects as they approve will be next submitted to the president who under the act is required to make final allocations.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0093.wav|the next step will be to notify the proper government agency
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0094.wav|in whose field the project falls, and also to notify another agency which i am creating a progress division.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0095.wav|this division will have the duty of coordinating the purchases of materials and supplies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0096.wav|and of making certain that people who are employed will be taken from the relief rolls.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0097.wav|it will also have the responsibility of determining work payments in various localities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0098.wav|of making full use of existing employment services and to assist people engaged in relief work
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0099.wav|to move as rapidly as possible back into private employment when such employment is available.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0100.wav|moreover, this division will be charged with keeping projects moving on schedule.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0101.wav|i have felt it to be essentially wise and prudent to avoid, so far as possible,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0102.wav|the creation of new governmental machinery for supervising this work.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0103.wav|the national government now has at least sixty different agencies with the staff
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0104.wav|and the experience and the competence necessary to carry on the two hundred and fifty or three hundred kinds of work that will be undertaken.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0105.wav|these agencies, therefore, will simply be doing on a somewhat enlarged scale the same sort of things that they have been doing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0106.wav|this will make certain that the largest possible portion of the funds allotted
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0107.wav|will be spent for actually creating new work and not for building up expensive overhead organizations here in washington.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0108.wav|for many months preparations have been under way.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0109.wav|the allotment of funds for desirable projects has already begun.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0110.wav|the key men for the major responsibilities of this great task already have been selected.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0111.wav|i well realize that the country is expecting before this year is out to see the "dirt fly", as they say, in carrying on the work,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0112.wav|and i assure my fellow citizens that no energy will be spared in using these funds effectively
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0113.wav|to make a major attack upon the problem of unemployment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0114.wav|our responsibility is to all of the people in this country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0115.wav|this is a great national crusade to destroy enforced idleness which is an enemy of the human spirit
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0116.wav|generated by this depression
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0117.wav|our attack upon these enemies must be without stint and without discrimination.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0119.wav|it must, however, be recognized that when an enterprise of this character is extended over more than three thousand counties throughout the nation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0120.wav|there may be occasional instances of inefficiency, bad management, or misuse of funds.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0121.wav|when cases of this kind occur,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0122.wav|there will be those, of course, who will try to tell you that the exceptional failure is characteristic of the entire endeavor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0123.wav|it should be remembered that in every big job there are some imperfections.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0124.wav|there are chiselers in every walk of life; there are those in every industry who are guilty of unfair practices;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0125.wav|every profession has its black sheep, but long experience in government has taught me
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0126.wav|that the exceptional instances of wrong doing in government are probably less numerous than in almost every other line of endeavor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0127.wav|the most effective means of preventing such evils in this works relief program will be the eternal vigilance of the american people themselves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0128.wav|i call upon my fellow citizens everywhere to cooperate with me
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0129.wav|in making this the most efficient and the cleanest example of public enterprise the world has ever seen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0130.wav|it is time to provide a smashing answer for those cynical men who say that a democracy cannot be honest and efficient.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0131.wav|if you will help, this can be done.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0132.wav|i, therefore, hope you will watch the work in every corner of this nation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0133.wav|feel free to criticize. tell me of instances where work can be done better, or where improper practices prevail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0134.wav|neither you nor i want criticism conceived in a purely fault finding or partisan spirit,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0135.wav|but i am jealous of the right of every citizen to call to the attention of his or her government
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0136.wav|examples of how the public money can be more effectively spent for the benefit of the american people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0137.wav|i now come, my friends, to a part of the remaining business before the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0138.wav|it has under consideration many measures which provide for the rounding out of the program of economic and social reconstruction
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0139.wav|with which we have been concerned for two years.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0140.wav|i can mention only a few of them tonight, but i do not want my mention of specific measures
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0141.wav|to be interpreted as lack of interest in or disapproval of many other important proposals that are pending.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0142.wav|the national industrial recovery act expires on the sixteenth of june.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0143.wav|after careful consideration, i have asked the congress to extend the life of this useful agency of government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0144.wav|as we have proceeded with the administration of this act,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0145.wav|we have found from time to time more and more useful ways of promoting its purposes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0146.wav|no reasonable person wants to abandon our present gains
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0147.wav|we must continue to protect children,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0148.wav|to enforce minimum wages, to prevent excessive hours,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0149.wav|to safeguard, define and enforce collective bargaining, and, while retaining fair competition,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0150.wav|to eliminate so far as humanly possible, the kinds of unfair practices by selfish minorities which unfortunately
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0151.wav|did more than anything else to bring about the recent collapse of industries.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0152.wav|there is likewise pending before the congress
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0153.wav|legislation to provide for the elimination of unnecessary holding companies in the public utility field.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0154.wav|i consider this legislation a positive recovery measure.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0155.wav|power production in this country is virtually back to the nineteen twenty nine peak.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0156.wav|the operating companies in the gas and electric utility field are by and large in good condition, but
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0157.wav|under holding company domination the utility industry has long been hopelessly at war within itself and with public sentiment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0158.wav|by far the greater part of the general decline in utility securities had occurred before i was inaugurated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0159.wav|the absentee management of unnecessary holding company control
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0160.wav|has lost touch with, and has lost the sympathy of, the communities it pretends to serve.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0161.wav|even more significantly it has given the country as a whole an uneasy apprehension of overconcentrated economic power.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0162.wav|a business that loses the confidence of its customers and the goodwill of the public cannot long continue to be a good risk for the investor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0163.wav|this legislation will serve the investor by ending the conditions which have caused that lack of confidence and goodwill.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0164.wav|it will put the public utility operating industry on a sound basis for the future,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0165.wav|both in its public relations and in its internal relations.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0166.wav|this legislation will not only in the long run result in providing lower electric and gas rates to the consumer,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0167.wav|but it will protect the actual value and earning power of properties now owned by thousands of investors
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0168.wav|who have little protection under the old laws against what used to be called frenzied finance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0169.wav|it will not destroy values.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0170.wav|not only business recovery, but the general economic recovery of the nation will be greatly stimulated by the enactment of legislation
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0171.wav|designed to improve the status of our transportation agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0172.wav|there is need for legislation providing for the regulation of interstate transportation by buses and trucks,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0173.wav|for the regulation of transportation by water, for the strengthening of our merchant marine and air transport,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0174.wav|for the strengthening of the interstate commerce commission to enable it to carry out a rounded conception of the national transportation system
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0175.wav|in which the benefits of private ownership are retained while the public stake in these important services is protected by the public's government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0176.wav|finally, the reestablishment of public confidence in the banks of the nation
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0177.wav|is one of the most hopeful results of our efforts as a nation to reestablish public confidence in private banking.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0178.wav|we all know that private banking actually exists by virtue of the permission of and regulation by the people as a whole,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0179.wav|speaking through their government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0180.wav|wise public policy, however, requires not only that banking be safe
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0181.wav|but that its resources be most fully utilized in the economic life of the country
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0182.wav|to this end it was decided more than twenty years ago
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0183.wav|that the government should assume the responsibility of providing a means by which the credit of the nation might be controlled,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0184.wav|not by a few private banking institutions, but by a body with public prestige and authority.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0185.wav|the answer to this demand was the federal reserve system.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0186.wav|twenty years of experience with this system have justified the efforts made to create it,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0187.wav|but these twenty years have shown by experience definite possibilities for improvement.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0188.wav|certain proposals made to amend the federal reserve act deserve prompt and favorable action by the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0189.wav|they are a minimum of wise readjustments of our federal reserve system in the light of past experience and present needs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0190.wav|these measures i have mentioned are, in large part, the program which under my constitutional duty i have recommended to the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0191.wav|they are essential factors in a rounded program for national recovery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0192.wav|they contemplate the enrichment of our national life
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0193.wav|by a sound and rational ordering of its various elements and wise provisions for the protection of the weak against the strong.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0194.wav|never since my inauguration in march, nineteen thirty three, have i felt so unmistakably the atmosphere of recovery.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0195.wav|but it is more than the recovery of the material basis of our individual lives.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0196.wav|it is the recovery of confidence in our democratic processes and institutions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0197.wav|we have survived all of the arduous burdens and the threatening dangers of a great economic calamity.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0198.wav|we have in the darkest moments of our national trials retained our faith in our own ability to master our destiny.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ022-0200.wav|renewed faith in the vast possibilities of human beings to improve their material and spiritual status

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0010.wav|we asked the nation to turn over all of its privately held gold, dollar for dollar, to the government of the united states.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0011.wav|today's recovery proves how right that policy was.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0017.wav|that we could not afford to take the risk of another great depression.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0018.wav|we also became convinced that the only way to avoid a repetition of those dark days was to have a government with power to prevent
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0019.wav|and to cure the abuses and the inequalities which had thrown that system out of joint.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0020.wav|we then began a program of remedying those abuses and inequalities to give balance and stability to our economic system
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0021.wav|to make it bomb proof against the causes of nineteen twenty nine.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0023.wav|and recovery is speeding up to a point where the dangers of nineteen twenty nine are again becoming possible,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0024.wav|not this week or month perhaps, but within a year or two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0025.wav|national laws are needed to complete that program.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0026.wav|individual or local or state effort alone cannot protect us in nineteen thirty seven any better than ten years ago.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0027.wav|it will take time and plenty of time to work out our remedies administratively even after legislation is passed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0028.wav|to complete our program of protection in time, therefore,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0029.wav|we cannot delay one moment in making certain that our national government has power to carry through.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0030.wav|four years ago action did not come until the eleventh hour.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0031.wav|it was almost too late.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0033.wav|we will not allow ourselves to run around in new circles of futile discussion and debate, always postponing the day of decision.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0036.wav|an overwhelming majority of them voted a mandate that the congress and the president begin the task of providing that protection
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0037.wav|not after long years of debate, but now.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0038.wav|the courts, however, have cast doubts on the ability of the elected congress to protect us against catastrophe
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0039.wav|by meeting squarely our modern social and economic conditions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0040.wav|we are at a crisis in our ability to proceed with that protection.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0041.wav|it is a quiet crisis. there are no lines of depositors outside closed banks.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0042.wav|but to the far sighted it is far reaching in its possibilities of injury to america.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0043.wav|i want to talk with you very simply about the need for present action in this crisis

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0045.wav|last thursday i described the american form of government as a three horse team provided by the constitution to the american people
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0046.wav|so that their field might be plowed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0047.wav|the three horses are, of course, the three branches of government the congress, the executive and the courts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0048.wav|two of the horses are pulling in unison today; the third is not.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0049.wav|those who have intimated that the president of the united states is trying to drive that team
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0050.wav|overlook the simple fact that the president, as chief executive, is himself one of the three horses.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0051.wav|it is the american people themselves who are in the driver's seat.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0052.wav|it is the american people themselves who want the furrow plowed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0053.wav|it is the american people themselves who expect the third horse to pull in unison with the other two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0054.wav|i hope that you have re read the constitution of the united states in these past few weeks.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0055.wav|like the bible, it ought to be read again and again.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0056.wav|it is an easy document to understand when you remember that it was called into being
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0057.wav|because the articles of confederation under which the original thirteen states tried to operate after the revolution
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0058.wav|showed the need of a national government with power enough to handle national problems.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0059.wav|in its preamble, the constitution states that it was intended to form a more perfect union and promote the general welfare;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0060.wav|and the powers given to the congress to carry out those purposes can be best described by saying
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0061.wav|that they were all the powers needed to meet each and every problem which then had a national character
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0062.wav|and which could not be met by merely local action.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0063.wav|but the framers went further.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0064.wav|having in mind that in succeeding generations many other problems then undreamed of would become national problems
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0065.wav|they gave to the congress the ample broad powers "to levy taxes
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0066.wav|and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the united states.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0067.wav|that, my friends, is what i honestly believe
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0068.wav|to have been the clear and underlying purpose of the patriots who wrote a federal constitution to create a national government
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0069.wav|with national power, intended as they said, "to form a more perfect union
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0070.wav|for ourselves and our posterity.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0071.wav|for nearly twenty years there was no conflict between the congress and the court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0072.wav|congress passed a statute which, in eighteen oh three, the court said violated an express provision of the constitution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0073.wav|the court claimed the power to declare it unconstitutional and did so declare it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0074.wav|but a little later the court itself admitted
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0075.wav|that it was an extraordinary power to exercise and through mister justice washington laid down this limitation upon it:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0076.wav|it is but a decent respect due to the wisdom, the integrity and the patriotism of the legislative body,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0077.wav|by which any law is passed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0078.wav|to presume in favor of its validity until its violation of the constitution is proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0079.wav|but since the rise of the modern movement for social and economic progress through legislation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0080.wav|the court has more and more often and more and more boldly
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0081.wav|asserted a power to veto laws passed by the congress and state legislatures in complete disregard of this original limitation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0082.wav|in the last four years the sound rule of giving statutes the benefit of all reasonable doubt has been cast aside.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0083.wav|the court has been acting not as a judicial body, but as a policy making body.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0084.wav|when the congress has sought to stabilize national agriculture, to improve the conditions of labor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0085.wav|to safeguard business against unfair competition,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0086.wav|to protect our national resources, and in many other ways, to serve our clearly national needs,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0087.wav|the majority of the court has been assuming the power to pass on the wisdom of these acts of the congress
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0088.wav|and to approve or disapprove the public policy written into these laws.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0089.wav|that is not only my accusation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0090.wav|it is the accusation of most distinguished justices of the present supreme court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0091.wav|i have not the time to quote to you all the language used by dissenting justices in many of these cases.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0092.wav|but in the case holding the railroad retirement act unconstitutional, for instance,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0093.wav|chief justice hughes said in a dissenting opinion that the majority opinion was "a departure from sound principles,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0094.wav|and placed "an unwarranted limitation upon the commerce clause."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0095.wav|and three other justices agreed with him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0096.wav|in the case of holding the a.a.a. unconstitutional,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0097.wav|justice stone said of the majority opinion that it was a "tortured construction of the constitution."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0098.wav|and two other justices agreed with him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0099.wav|in the case holding the new york minimum wage law unconstitutional, justice stone said
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0100.wav|that the majority were actually reading into the constitution their own "personal economic predilections," and that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0101.wav|if the legislative power is not left free to choose the methods of solving the problems of poverty,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0102.wav|subsistence, and health of large numbers in the community, then
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0103.wav|government is to be rendered impotent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0104.wav|and two other justices agreed with him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0105.wav|in the face of these dissenting opinions, there is no basis for the claim made by some members of the court
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0106.wav|that something in the constitution has compelled them regretfully to thwart the will of the people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0107.wav|in the face of such dissenting opinions, it is perfectly clear that, as chief justice hughes has said,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0108.wav|we are under a constitution, but the constitution is what the judges say it is.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0109.wav|the court in addition to the proper use of its judicial functions has improperly set itself up as a third house of the congress
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0110.wav|a super legislature, as one of the justices has called it
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0111.wav|reading into the constitution words and implications which are not there, and which were never intended to be there.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0112.wav|we have, therefore,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0113.wav|reached the point as a nation where we must take action to save the constitution from the court and the court from itself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0114.wav|we must find a way to take an appeal from the supreme court to the constitution itself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0115.wav|we want a supreme court which will do justice under the constitution not over it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0116.wav|in our courts we want a government of laws and not of men.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0117.wav|i want as all americans want an independent judiciary as proposed by the framers of the constitution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0118.wav|that means a supreme court that will enforce the constitution as written
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0119.wav|that will refuse to amend the constitution by the arbitrary exercise of judicial power amended by judicial say so.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0120.wav|it does not mean a judiciary so independent that it can deny the existence of facts which are universally recognized.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0121.wav|how then could we proceed to perform the mandate given us?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0122.wav|it was said in last year's democratic platform,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0123.wav|if these problems cannot be effectively solved within the constitution,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0124.wav|we shall seek such clarifying amendment as will assure the power to enact those laws,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0125.wav|adequately to regulate commerce, protect public health and safety, and safeguard economic security.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0126.wav|in other words, we said we would seek an amendment only if every other possible means by legislation were to fail.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0127.wav|when i commenced to review the situation with the problem squarely before me,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0128.wav|i came by a process of elimination to the conclusion that, short of amendments,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0129.wav|the only method which was clearly constitutional, and would at the same time carry out other much needed reforms,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0130.wav|was to infuse new blood into all our courts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0131.wav|we must have men worthy and equipped to carry out impartial justice.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0132.wav|but, at the same time, we must have judges who will bring to the courts a present day sense of the constitution
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0133.wav|judges who will retain in the courts the judicial functions of a court,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0134.wav|and reject the legislative powers which the courts have today assumed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0135.wav|in forty five out of the forty eight states of the union, judges are chosen not for life but for a period of years.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0136.wav|in many states judges must retire at the age of seventy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0137.wav|congress has provided financial security
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0138.wav|by offering life pensions at full pay for federal judges on all courts who are willing to retire at seventy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0139.wav|in the case of supreme court justices, that pension is twenty thousand dollars a year.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0140.wav|but all federal judges, once appointed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ023-0141.wav|can, if they choose, hold office for life, no matter how old they may get to be.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0003.wav|what is my proposal?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0004.wav|it is simply this: whenever a judge or justice of any federal court
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0005.wav|has reached the age of seventy and does not avail himself of the opportunity to retire on a pension,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0006.wav|a new member shall be appointed by the president then in office,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0007.wav|with the approval, as required by the constitution, of the senate of the united states.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0008.wav|that plan has two chief purposes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0009.wav|by bringing into the judicial system a steady and continuing stream of new and younger blood, i hope, first,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0010.wav|to make the administration of all federal justice speedier and, therefore, less costly;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0011.wav|secondly, to bring to the decision of social and economic problems younger men who have had personal experience and contact
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0012.wav|with modern facts and circumstances under which average men have to live and work.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0013.wav|this plan will save our national constitution from hardening of the judicial arteries.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0014.wav|the number of judges to be appointed would depend wholly on the decision of present judges now over seventy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0015.wav|or those who would subsequently reach the age of seventy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0016.wav|if, for instance, any one of the six justices of the supreme court now over the age of seventy should retire as provided under the plan,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0017.wav|no additional place would be created.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0018.wav|consequently, although there never can be more than fifteen, there may be only fourteen, or thirteen, or twelve.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0030.wav|the plan has met opposition only so far as the supreme court of the united states itself is concerned.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0034.wav|what do they mean by the words "packing the court"?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0035.wav|let me answer this question with a bluntness that will end all honest misunderstanding of my purposes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0036.wav|if by that phrase "packing the court" it is charged that i wish to place on the bench spineless puppets
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0037.wav|who would disregard the law and would decide specific cases as i wished them to be decided, i make this answer:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0038.wav|that no president fit for his office would appoint,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0039.wav|and no senate of honorable men fit for their office would confirm, that kind of appointees to the supreme court.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0041.wav|that i would appoint and the senate would confirm justices worthy to sit beside present members of the court
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0042.wav|who understand those modern conditions,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0043.wav|that i will appoint justices who will not undertake to override the judgment of the congress on legislative policy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0044.wav|that i will appoint justices who will act as justices and not as legislators
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0045.wav|if the appointment of such justices can be called "packing the courts,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0046.wav|then i say that i and with me the vast majority of the american people favor doing just that thing now.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0047.wav|is it a dangerous precedent for the congress to change the number of the justices? the congress has always had, and will have, that power.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0052.wav|in accordance with a clearly defined principle relating to a clearly defined age limit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0053.wav|fundamentally, if in the future, america cannot trust the congress it elects to refrain from abuse of our constitutional usages
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0054.wav|democracy will have failed far beyond the importance to it of any king of precedent concerning the judiciary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0055.wav|we think it so much in the public interest to maintain a vigorous judiciary
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0056.wav|that we encourage the retirement of elderly judges by offering them a life pension at full salary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0057.wav|why then should we leave the fulfillment of this public policy to chance
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0058.wav|or make independent on upon the desire or prejudice of any individual justice?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0059.wav|it is the clear intention of our public policy to provide for a constant flow of new and younger blood into the judiciary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0060.wav|normally every president appoints a large number of district and circuit court judges and a few members of the supreme court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0061.wav|until my first term practically every president of the united states has appointed at least one member of the supreme court.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0062.wav|president taft appointed five members and named a chief justice;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0063.wav|president wilson, three; president harding, four, including a chief justice; president coolidge, one;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0064.wav|president hoover, three, including a chief justice.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0065.wav|such a succession of appointments should have provided a court well balanced as to age.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0066.wav|but chance and the disinclination of individuals to leave the supreme bench
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0067.wav|have now given us a court in which five justices will be over seventy five years of age before next june
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0068.wav|and one over seventy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0069.wav|thus a sound public policy has been defeated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0070.wav|i now propose that we establish by law an assurance against any such ill balanced court in the future.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0071.wav|i propose that hereafter, when a judge reaches the age of seventy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0072.wav|a new and younger judge shall be added to the court automatically.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0073.wav|in this way i propose to enforce a sound public policy by law
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0074.wav|instead of leaving the composition of our federal courts, including the highest,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0075.wav|to be determined by chance or the personal indecision of individuals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0076.wav|if such a law as i propose is regarded as establishing a new precedent,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0077.wav|is it not a most desirable precedent?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0078.wav|like all lawyers, like all americans, i regret the necessity of this controversy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0079.wav|but the welfare of the united states, and indeed of the constitution itself, is what we all must think about first.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0080.wav|our difficulty with the court today rises not from the court as an institution but from human beings within it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0081.wav|but we cannot yield our constitutional destiny to the personal judgment of a few men who, being fearful of the future,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0082.wav|would deny us the necessary means of dealing with the present.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0083.wav|this plan of mine is no attack on the court;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0084.wav|it seeks to restore the court to its rightful and historic place in our constitutional government
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0085.wav|and to have it resume its high task of building anew on the constitution "a system of living law."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0086.wav|the court itself can best undo what the court has done.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0087.wav|i have thus explained to you the reasons that lie behind our efforts to secure results by legislation within the constitution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0088.wav|i hope that thereby the difficult process of constitutional amendment may be rendered unnecessary. but,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0089.wav|let us examine the process.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0090.wav|there are many types of amendment proposed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0091.wav|each one is radically different from the other.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0092.wav|there is no substantial groups within the congress or outside it who are agreed on any single amendment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0093.wav|it would take months or years to get substantial agreement upon the type and language of the amendment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0094.wav|it would take months and years thereafter to get a two thirds majority in favor of that amendment in both houses of the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0095.wav|then would come the long course of ratification by three fourths of all the states.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0096.wav|no amendment which any powerful economic interests or the leaders of any powerful political party have had reason to oppose
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0097.wav|has ever been ratified within anything like a reasonable time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0098.wav|and thirteen states which contain only five percent of the voting population can block ratification
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0099.wav|even though the thirty five states with ninety five percent of the population are in favor of it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0100.wav|a very large percentage of newspaper publishers, chambers of commerce,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0101.wav|bar association, manufacturers' associations, who are trying to give the impression that they really do want a constitutional amendment
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0102.wav|would be the first to exclaim as soon as an amendment was proposed
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0103.wav|oh! i was for an amendment all right, but this amendment you proposed is not the kind of amendment that i was thinking about.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0104.wav|i am therefore, going to spend my time, my efforts and my money
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0105.wav|to block the amendment, although i would be awfully glad to help get some other kind of amendment ratified.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0106.wav|two groups oppose my plan on the ground that they favor a constitutional amendment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0107.wav|the first includes those who fundamentally object to social and economic legislation along modern lines.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0108.wav|this is the same group who during the campaign last fall tried to block the mandate of the people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0109.wav|now they are making a last stand.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0110.wav|and the strategy of that last stand is to suggest the time consuming process of amendment in order to kill off by delay
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0111.wav|the legislation demanded by the mandate.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0112.wav|to them i say: i do not think you will be able long to fool the american people as to your purposes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0113.wav|the other groups is composed of those who honestly believe the amendment process is the best
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0114.wav|and who would be willing to support a reasonable amendment if they could agree on one.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0115.wav|to them i say: we cannot rely on an amendment as the immediate or only answer to our present difficulties.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0116.wav|when the time comes for action,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0117.wav|you will find that many of those who pretend to support you will sabotage any constructive amendment which is proposed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0118.wav|look at these strange bed fellows of yours.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0119.wav|when before have you found them really at your side in your fights for progress?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0120.wav|and remember one thing more.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0121.wav|even if an amendment were passed, and even if in the years to come it were to be ratified,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0122.wav|its meaning would depend upon the kind of justices who would be sitting on the supreme court bench.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0123.wav|an amendment, like the rest of the constitution,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0124.wav|is what the justices say it is rather than what its framers or you might hope it is.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0125.wav|this proposal of mine will not infringe in the slightest upon the civil or religious liberties so dear to every american.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0126.wav|my record as governor and president proves my devotion to those liberties.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0127.wav|you who know me can have no fear that i would tolerate the destruction by any branch of government of any part of our heritage of freedom.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0128.wav|the present attempt by those opposed to progress to play upon the fears of danger to personal liberty
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0129.wav|brings again to mind that crude and cruel strategy tried by the same opposition
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0130.wav|to frighten the workers of america in a pay envelope propaganda against the social security law.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0131.wav|the workers were not fooled by that propaganda then. the people of america will not be fooled by such propaganda now.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0132.wav|i am in favor of action through legislation:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0133.wav|first, because i believe that it can be passed at this session of the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0134.wav|second, because it will provide a reinvigorated
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0135.wav|liberal minded judiciary necessary to furnish quicker and cheaper justice from bottom to top.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0136.wav|third, because it will provide a series of federal courts willing to enforce the constitution as written,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0137.wav|and unwilling to assert legislative powers by writing into it their own political and economic policies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0138.wav|during the past half century the balance of power between the three great branches of the federal government,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ024-0139.wav|has been tipped out of balance by the courts in direct contradiction of the high purposes of the framers of the constitution.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0011.wav|is huxley's famous essay, "the border territory between the animal and vegetable kingdoms," written in eighteen seventy six,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0029.wav|while the atmosphere and the earth supply plants with juices ready prepared and which can be absorbed immediately.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0030.wav|as the animal body required to be independent of heat and of the atmosphere,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0031.wav|there were no means by which the motion of its fluids could be produced by internal causes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0032.wav|hence arose the second great distinctive character of animals, or the circulatory system, which is less important than the digestive,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0033.wav|since it was unnecessary, and therefore is absent, in the more simple animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0034.wav|animals further needed muscles for locomotion and nerves for sensibility.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0035.wav|hence, says cuvier, it was necessary that the chemical composition of the animal body should be more complicated than that of the plant;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0036.wav|and it is so, inasmuch as an additional substance nitrogen enters into it as an essential element;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0037.wav|while in plants nitrogen is only accidentally joined with the three other fundamental constituents of organic beings
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0038.wav|carbon, hydrogen and oxygen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0039.wav|he afterward affirms that nitrogen is peculiar to animals, and herein he places the third distinction between the animal and the plant.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0040.wav|the soil and the atmosphere supply plants with water composed of hydrogen and oxygen
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0041.wav|and carbonic acid containing carbon and oxygen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0042.wav|they retain the hydrogen and the carbon, exhale the superfluous oxygen and absorb little or no nitrogen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0043.wav|the essential character of vegetable life is the exhalation of oxygen, which is effected through the agency of light.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0044.wav|animals, on the contrary, derive their nourishment either directly or indirectly from plants.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0045.wav|they get rid of the superfluous hydrogen and carbon and accumulate nitrogen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0046.wav|the relations of plants and animals to the atmosphere are therefore inverse.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0047.wav|the plant withdraws water and carbonic acid from the atmosphere, the animal contributes both to it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0048.wav|respiration that is, the absorption of oxygen and the exhalation of carbonic acid
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0049.wav|is the specially animal function of animals and constitutes their fourth distinctive character.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0050.wav|thus wrote cuvier in eighteen twenty eight.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0051.wav|but in the fourth and fifth decades of this century
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0052.wav|the greatest and most rapid revolution which biological science has ever undergone was effected by the application of the modern microscope
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0053.wav|to the investigation of organic structure,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0054.wav|by the introduction of exact and easily manageable methods of conducting the chemical analysis of organic compounds and finally
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0055.wav|by the employment of instruments of precision for the measurement of the physical forces which are at work in the living economy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0056.wav|that the semi fluid contents (which we now term protoplasm) of the cells of certain plants,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0057.wav|such as the charae, are in constant and regular motion was made out by bonaventura corti a century ago;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0058.wav|but the fact, important as it was, fell into oblivion and had to be rediscovered by treviranus in eighteen oh seven.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0059.wav|robert brown noted the more complex motions of the protoplasm in the cells of tradescantia in eighteen thirty one,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0060.wav|and now such movements of the living substance of plants are well known to be some of the most widely prevalent phenomena of vegetable life.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0061.wav|agardh and other of the botanists of cuvier's generation who occupied themselves with the lower plants had observed that,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0062.wav|under particular circumstances, the contents of the cells of certain water weeds were set free and moved about with considerable velocity
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0063.wav|and with all the appearances of spontaneity as locomotive bodies,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0064.wav|which, from their similarity to animals of simple organization, were called "zoospores."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0065.wav|even as late as eighteen forty five, however, a botanist of schleiden's eminence dealt very skeptically with these statements,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0066.wav|and his skepticism was the more justified since ehrenberg in his elaborate and comprehensive work on the infusoria,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0067.wav|had declared the greater number of what are now recognized as locomotive plants to be animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0068.wav|"at the present day," writes huxley,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0069.wav|innumerable plants and free plant cells are known to pass the whole or part of their lives in an actively locomotive condition,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0070.wav|in nowise distinguishable from that of one of the simpler animals, and
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0071.wav|while in this condition their movements are, to all appearances, as spontaneous as much the product of volition as those of such animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0072.wav|hence the teleological argument for cuvier's first diagnostic character
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0073.wav|the presence in animals of an alimentary cavity, or internal pocket, in which they can carry about their nutriment
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0074.wav|has broken down, so far, at least, as his mode of stating it goes. and
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0075.wav|with the advance of microscopic anatomy, the universality of the fact itself among animals has ceased to be predicable.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0076.wav|many animals of even complex structure which live parasitically within others are wholly devoid of an alimentary cavity.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0077.wav|their food is provided for them,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0078.wav|not only ready cooked but ready digested, and the alimentary canal, become superfluous, has disappeared, and, again,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0079.wav|the males of most rotifers have no digestive apparatus.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0080.wav|finally amid the lowest forms of animal life the speck of gelatinous protoplasm, which constitutes the whole body,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0081.wav|has no permanent digestive cavity or mouth, but takes in its food anywhere and digests, so to speak, all over its body.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0082.wav|but although cuvier's leading diagnosis of the animal from the plant will not stand a strict test,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0083.wav|it remains one of the most constant of the distinctive characters of animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0084.wav|and if we substitute for the possession of an alimentary cavity the power of taking solid nutriment into the body and there digesting it,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0085.wav|the definition so changed will cover all animals, except certain parasites,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0086.wav|and the few and exceptional cases of non parasitic animals which do not feed at all.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0087.wav|on the other hand, the definition thus amended will exclude all ordinary vegetable organisms.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0088.wav|cuvier himself practically gives up his second distinctive mark when he admits that it is wanting in the simpler animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0089.wav|the third distinction is based on a completely erroneous conception of the chemical differences
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0090.wav|and resemblances between the constituents of animal and vegetable organisms, for which cuvier is not responsible,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0091.wav|as it was current among contemporary chemists.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0092.wav|it is now established that nitrogen is as essential a constituent of vegetable as of animal living matter
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0093.wav|and that the latter is, chemically speaking, just as complicated as the former.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0094.wav|starchy substances, cellulose and sugar,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0095.wav|once supposed to be exclusively confined to plants, are now known to be regular and normal products of animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0096.wav|amylaceous and saccharine substances are largely manufactured, even by the highest animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0097.wav|cellulose is widespread as a constituent of the skeletons of the lower animals
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0098.wav|and it is probable that amyloid substances are universally present in the animal organism, though not in the precise form of starch.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0099.wav|moreover, although it remains true that there is an inverse relation between the green plant in sunshine and the animal,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0100.wav|in so far as under these circumstances the green plant
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0101.wav|decomposes carbonic acid and exhales oxygen while the animal absorbs oxygen and exhales carbonic acid,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0102.wav|yet the exact researches of the modern chemical investigators of the physiological processes of plants have clearly demonstrated the fallacy
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0103.wav|of attempting to draw any general distinction between animals and vegetables on this ground. in fact, the difference vanishes with the sunshine,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0104.wav|even in the case of the green plant, which in the dark absorbs oxygen and gives out carbonic acid like any animal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0105.wav|on the other hand, those plants, such as the fungi,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0106.wav|which contain no chlorophyll and are not green, are always, so far as respiration is concerned, in the exact position of animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0107.wav|they absorb oxygen and give out carbonic acid.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0108.wav|thus, by the progress of knowledge, cuvier's fourth distinction between the animal and the plant
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0109.wav|has been as completely invalidated as the third and second, and even the first can be retained only in a modified form
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0110.wav|and subject to exceptions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0111.wav|but has the advance of biology simply tended to break down old distinctions without establishing new ones?
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0112.wav|with a qualification, to be considered presently, the answer to this question is undoubtedly in the affirmative.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0113.wav|the famous researches of schwann and schleiden in eighteen thirty seven and the following years
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0114.wav|founded the modern science of histology or that branch of anatomy which deals with the ultimate visible structure of organisms as revealed by the microscope,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0115.wav|and from that day to this the rapid improvement of methods of investigation and the energy of a host of accurate observers
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0116.wav|have given greater and greater breadth and firmness to schwann's great generalization
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0117.wav|that a fundamental unity of structure obtains in animals and plants,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0118.wav|and that, however diverse may be the fabrics or tissues of which their bodies are composed, all these varied structures result
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0119.wav|from the metamorphosis of morphological units (termed cells in a more general sense than that in which the word "cells" was at first employed),
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0120.wav|which are not only similar in animals and in plants respectively,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0121.wav|but present a close resemblance when those of animals and those of plants are compared together.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0122.wav|the contractility which is the fundamental condition of locomotion," continues huxley,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0123.wav|has not only been discovered to exist far more widely among plants than was formerly imagined,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0124.wav|but in the plants the act of contraction has been found to be accompanied,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0125.wav|as doctor burdon sanderson's interesting investigations have shown, by a disturbance of the electrical state of the contractile substance
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0126.wav|comparable to that which was found by du bois reymond to be a concomitant of the activity of ordinary muscle in animals. again,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0127.wav|i know of no test by which the reaction of the leaves of the sundew and of other plants to stimuli, so fully and carefully studied by mister darwin,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0128.wav|can be distinguished from those acts of contraction following upon stimuli, which are called "reflex" in animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0129.wav|on each lobe of the bi lobed leaf of venus flytrap are three delicate filaments which stand out at right angles from the surface of the leaf.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0130.wav|touch one of them with the end of a fine human hair
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0131.wav|and the lobes of the leaf instantly close together in virtue of an act of contraction of part of their substance,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0132.wav|just as the body of a snail contracts into its shell when one of its "horns" is irritated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0133.wav|the reflex action of the snail is the result of the presence of a nervous system in the animal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0134.wav|a molecular change takes place in the nerve of the tentacle,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0135.wav|is propagated to the muscles by which the body is retracted, and causing them to contract, the act of retraction is brought about.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0136.wav|of course the similarity of the acts does not necessarily involve the conclusion that the mechanism by which they are effected is the same
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0137.wav|but it suggests a suspicion of their identity which needs careful testing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0138.wav|the results of inquiries into the structure of the nervous system of animals
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0139.wav|converge toward the conclusion that the nerve fibers, which have been regarded as ultimate elements of nervous tissue,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0140.wav|are not such, but are simply the visible aggregations of vastly more attenuated filaments,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0141.wav|the diameter of which dwindles down to the limits of our present microscopic vision,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0142.wav|greatly as these have been extended by modern improvements of the microscope, and that a nerve is, in its essence,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0143.wav|nothing but a linear tract of specially modified protoplasm between two points of an organism
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0144.wav|one of which is able to affect the other by means of the communication so established.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0145.wav|hence it is conceivable that even the simplest living being may possess a nervous system.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0146.wav|and the question whether plants are provided with a nervous system or not thus acquires a new aspect and presents the histologist and physiologist
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0147.wav|with a problem of extreme difficulty, which must be attacked from a new point of view and by the aid of methods which have yet to be invented.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0148.wav|"thus it must be admitted," he says again, "that plants may be contractile and locomotive;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0149.wav|that, while locomotive, their movements may have as much appearance of spontaneity as those of the lowest animals,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0150.wav|and that many exhibit actions comparable to those which are brought about by the agency of a nervous system in animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0151.wav|and it must be allowed to be possible that further research may reveal the existence of something comparable to a nervous system in plants.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0152.wav|so that i know not where we can hope to find any absolute distinction between animals and plants, unless we return to their mode of nutrition
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0153.wav|and inquire whether certain differences of a more occult character than those imagined to exist by cuvier,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0154.wav|and which certainly hold good for the vast majority of animals and plants, are of universal application.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0155.wav|a bean may be supplied with water in which salts of ammonia and certain other mineral salts are dissolved in due proportion,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0156.wav|with atmospheric air containing its ordinary minute dose of carbonic acid and with nothing else but sunlight and heat.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0157.wav|under these circumstances, unnatural as they are, with proper management, the bean will thrust forth its radicle and its plumule;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0158.wav|the former will grow down into roots, the latter grow up into the stem and leaves of a vigorous bean plant,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0159.wav|and this plant will, in due time, flower and produce its crop of beans just as if it were grown in the garden or in the field.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0162.wav|will be vastly greater than the weight of the same substances contained in the bean from which it sprang.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0163.wav|but nothing has been supplied to the bean save water, carbonic acid, ammonia, potash, lime,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0164.wav|iron and the like in combination with phosphoric, sulphuric and other acids.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0165.wav|neither protein, nor fat, nor starch, nor sugar, nor any substance in the slightest degree resembling them has formed part of the food of the bean.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0166.wav|but the weights of the carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur and other elementary bodies contained in the bean plant

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0168.wav|whence it follows that the bean has taken in only the raw materials of its fabric and has manufactured them into bean stuffs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0169.wav|the bean has been able to perform this great chemical feat by the help of its green coloring matter, or chlorophyll,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0170.wav|for it is only the green parts of the plant which, under the influence of sunlight, have the marvelous power of decomposing carbonic acid,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0172.wav|in fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0173.wav|the watery solution, in which its roots are plunged, contains nitrogen but no carbon;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ025-0175.wav|but its nitrogen is in the state of a free gas, in which condition the bean can make no use of it,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0008.wav|and the beginner in biological study is surprised to find them described in textbooks of both botany and zoology.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0030.wav|the distinction between the higher plants and animals is perfectly sharp and obvious,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0031.wav|but when the two groups are traced downward they are found gradually to merge,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0032.wav|as it were, into an assemblage of organisms which partake of the characters of both kingdoms and cannot without a certain violence
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0033.wav|be either included in or excluded from either.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0034.wav|when any given "protist" has to be classified the case must be decided on its individual merits;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0035.wav|the organism must be compared in detail with all those which resemble it closely in structure, physiology and life history,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0036.wav|and then a balance must be struck and the doubtful form placed in the kingdom with which it has, on the whole, most points in common.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0037.wav|it will no doubt occur to the reader that, on the theory of evolution,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0038.wav|the fact of the animal and vegetable kingdoms being related to one another like two trees united at the roots may be accounted for by the hypothesis that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0039.wav|the earliest organisms were protists and that from them animals and plants were evolved along divergent lines of descent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0040.wav|and in this connection the fact that some bacteria the simplest organisms known and devoid of chlorophyll
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0041.wav|may flourish in solutions wholly devoid of organic matter is very significant.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0042.wav|the lower plants and animals referred to above are so far from everyday observation
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0043.wav|and hence so unfamiliar that to most people the comparison made will mean little in terms of ordinary green flowering plants and common vertebrate animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0044.wav|in order to emphasize the fundamental similarity of organic function in higher and lower animals and plants, let us compare any higher plant
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0045.wav|e.g., a bean plant with a higher animal, e.g., frog or even man.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0046.wav|in each the life is the sum total of a series of definite processes nutrition or food supply,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0047.wav|circulation, metabolism, excretion, oxygenation (part of respiration),
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0048.wav|movement, irritability (nervous activity) and reproduction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0049.wav|in turn these will be compared for the animal and the plant,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0050.wav|following in part the comparisons of certain animals and plants by sedgwick and wilson and others.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0051.wav|these comparisons will, however, be translated into terms applicable to any species of higher plants or animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0052.wav|in the nutrition of the animal the most essential and characteristic part of the food supply is derived from vegetable
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0053.wav|or animal matter in the form of various organic compounds, of which the most important are proteids (protoplasm, albumen, etc.),
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0054.wav|carbohydrates (starch, cellulose) and fats.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0055.wav|these materials are used by the animal in the manufacture of new protoplasm to take the place of that which has been used up.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0056.wav|it is, however, impossible for the animal to build these materials directly into the substance of its own body.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0057.wav|they must first undergo certain preparatory chemical changes known collectively as digestion
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0058.wav|and only after the completion of this process can all the food be absorbed into the circulation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0059.wav|for this purpose the food is taken not into the body proper, but into a kind of tubular chemical laboratory; called the alimentary canal,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0060.wav|through which it slowly passes, being subjected meanwhile to the action of certain chemical substances or reagents, known as digestive ferments.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0061.wav|these substances, which are dissolved in a watery liquid to form the digestive fluid, are secreted by the walls of the alimentary tube.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0062.wav|through their action the solid portions are liquefied and the food is rendered capable of absorption into the body proper.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0063.wav|the food supply of the higher plant, like that of the animal, is the source of the required matter and energy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0064.wav|but unlike that of the animal, it is not chiefly an income of foods, but only of the raw materials of food.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0065.wav|matter enters the plant in the liquid or gaseous form by diffusion,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0066.wav|both from the soil through the roots (liquids) and from the atmosphere through the leaves (gases).
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0067.wav|we have here the direct absorption into the body proper of food stuffs precisely as the animal takes in water and oxygen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0068.wav|energy enters the plant, to a small extent,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0069.wav|as the potential energy of foodstuffs, but comes in principally as the kinetic energy of sunlight absorbed in the leaves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0070.wav|of the substances the solids (salts, etc.) must be dissolved in water before they can be taken in.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0071.wav|water and dissolved salts continually pass by diffusion from the soil into the roots, where together they constitute the sap.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0072.wav|the sap travels throughout the whole plant, the main though not the only cause of movement
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0073.wav|being the constant transpiration (evaporation) of watery vapor from the leaves, especially through the stomata.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0074.wav|the gaseous matters (carbon dioxide, oxygen, nitrogen) enter the plant mainly by diffusion from the atmosphere,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0075.wav|are dissolved by the sap in the leaves and elsewhere and thus may pass to every portion of the plant.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0076.wav|the green plant owes its power of absorbing the energy of sunlight
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0077.wav|to the chlorophyll bodies or chromatophores, for plants which, like fungi, etc., are devoid of chlorophyll, are unable thus to acquire energy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0078.wav|entering the chlorophyll bodies, the kinetic energy of sunlight is applied to the decomposition of carbon dioxide and water.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0079.wav|after passing through manifold but imperfectly known processes, the elements of these substances finally reappear as starch,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0080.wav|often in the form of granules embedded in the chlorophyll bodies and free oxygen, most of which is returned to the atmosphere.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0081.wav|thus the leaf of a green plant in the light is continually absorbing carbon dioxide and giving forth free oxygen.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0082.wav|carbon dioxide and water contain no potential energy, since the affinities of their constituent elements are completely satisfied.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0083.wav|starch, however, contains potential energy, since the molecule is relatively unstable
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0084.wav|i.e., capable of decomposition into simpler, stabler molecules in which stronger affinities are satisfied.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0085.wav|and this is due to the fact that in the manufacture of starch in the chlorophyll bodies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0086.wav|the kinetic energy of sunlight was expended in lifting the atoms into position of vantage, thus endowing them with energy of position.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0087.wav|in this way some of the radiant and kinetic energy of the sun comes to be stored up as potential energy in the starch.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0088.wav|in short, the green plant is able by cooperation with sunlight to use simple raw materials (carbon dioxide, water, oxygen, etc.)
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0089.wav|poor in energy or devoid of it, and out of them to manufacture food i.e. complex compounds rich in available potential energy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0090.wav|this power is possessed by green plants alone; all other organisms being dependent for energy upon the potential energy of ready made food.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0091.wav|this must, in the first instance, be provided for them by green plants, and hence without chlorophyll bearing plants,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0092.wav|animals (and colorless plants as well) apparently could not long exist.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0093.wav|the plant absorbs also a small amount of kinetic energy, independently of the sunlight, in the form of heat.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0094.wav|this, however, is probably not a source of vital energy, but only contributes to the maintenance of the body temperature.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0095.wav|food (starch) thus produced in the green leaves of higher plants and the inorganic foods
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0096.wav|water, nitrites or nitrates and various mineral substances in solution in water
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0097.wav|furnish the materials and energy required for the life and growth of the plant.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0098.wav|the circulatory system distributes these foods. in animals foods prepared for absorption in the stomach and intestine (by digestion)
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0099.wav|are absorbed by the circulating liquids (blood and lymph) and transported to all cells of the animal body.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0100.wav|in the plant the inorganic matter in water from the soil are absorbed by the roots and carried up definite tubes in the woody part of the stem.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0101.wav|the causes of this ascent are not clear,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0102.wav|but root pressure due to osmosis, capillary action and evaporation from the leaves are factors.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0103.wav|just as the solid food of animals must be digested in preparation for absorption,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0104.wav|so starch manufactured in the leaves must be digested (dissolved) before it can be transported.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0105.wav|this is done by diastase, an enzyme of plant cells.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0106.wav|the change is from starch to a sugar capable of diffusion.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0107.wav|dissolved in water, the sugar is transported down delicate tubes, chiefly in the growing bark region of the stem.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0108.wav|it is clear that there are upward and downward currents of water containing food (comparable to blood of an animal),
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0109.wav|but no system of complete circulation as in the blood vessels of a higher animal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0110.wav|however, the result in distributed food is the same in the plant and in the animal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0111.wav|in the cells the foods undergo metabolic changes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0112.wav|in an animal the foods in the circulating liquids, blood and lymph, are selected and absorbed by the cells.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0113.wav|only proteid foods form new protoplasm
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0114.wav|and even of proteids only a limited amount, seventy five to one hundred grams a day for a man, is built into new protoplasm.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0115.wav|the excess undergoes oxidation and forms nitrogen excretions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0116.wav|the foods containing only the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen (fats and carbohydrates)
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0117.wav|are directly oxidized to excretions and, lacking nitrogen, cannot serve for making new animal protoplasm.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0118.wav|fat and carbohydrate foods, then, never become living matter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0119.wav|they may be stored, especially as fat, until needed for oxidation to supply energy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0120.wav|the building up of the protoplasm from proteids is anabolism, constructive metabolism.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0121.wav|the destruction of protoplasm, excess proteids or the fat and carbohydrate foods is catabolism, destructive metabolism.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0122.wav|catabolism is probably due to enzyme action, but the final result is chiefly carbon dioxide and water,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0123.wav|which could be derived by the ordinary chemical evolution of protoplasm, proteid, sugar, starch or fats.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0124.wav|in the plant, starch, as has been seen, is first formed in the chlorophyll bodies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0125.wav|but the formation of starch, all important as it is, is after all only the manufacture of food
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0126.wav|as a preliminary to the real processes of nutrition.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0127.wav|these processes must take place everywhere in ordinary protoplasm,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0128.wav|for it is here that oxidation occurs and the need for a renewal of matter and energy consequently arises.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0129.wav|sooner or later the starch grains are changed into a kind of sugar (glucose), which, unlike starch, dissolves in the sap

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0147.wav|in the higher plants the excretions are carbon dioxide, which escapes through the epidermis of root, stem and leaf and through the stomata;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0153.wav|the other part of respiration, elimination of carbon dioxide, has been treated under excretions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ026-0154.wav|in the animal oxygen is absorbed by the blood, in excess by the hemoglobin of the red cells of the blood

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0019.wav|and at last each organism or each alliance of organisms must come to the greatest concession of all, which is called death.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0021.wav|whatever emphasis is laid upon the diversity of life, the essential unity of all organisms must not be forgotten.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0023.wav|that the only reasonable explanation for the existence of a fundamental unity in organic life
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0024.wav|is the theory of descent i.e., that similarities are due to blood relationship and that differences come from adaptive modifications.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0025.wav|the facts adduced from morphology, being the result of researches into the structure of adult animals and plants,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0026.wav|lead to a preview of certain principles of adaptation, necessary for their interpretation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0027.wav|first, it must be noted that some structures are not non adaptive, that is, do not change to fit changed habits or conditions of life.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0028.wav|such structures or organs are most often found internally.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0029.wav|for illustration: a change in the locomotive habit of a bird from that of flying to that of an ostrich
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0030.wav|is associated with an adaptive modification of locomotor structures, legs and wings,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0031.wav|but not in any striking way is there change in the internal organs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0032.wav|internal organs may persist unchanged and hence they offer good guides to classification.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0033.wav|on the other hand, external structures are likely to undergo adaptation when habits or conditions of life change.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0034.wav|hence, as jordan has said, "the inside of an animal tells the real history of its ancestry; the outside tells us only where its ancestors have been."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0035.wav|in the second place, it must be noted that adaptations to similar conditions may result in superficial resemblances.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0036.wav|for example, there is a superficial resemblance between the wing of an insect and the wing of a bird
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0037.wav|both adaptations to an aerial environment;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0038.wav|between the heart of an insect and the heart of a vertebrate animal
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0039.wav|both adaptations for pumping blood;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0040.wav|between the fin of a fish and the paddle of a whale
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0041.wav|both adaptive swimming organs, yet the resemblance in these cases does not go deeper than the surface it is one of function only.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0042.wav|all such cases of resemblance in function but not in detailed plan of structure are called "analogies,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0043.wav|and mean nothing more than similarity of environment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0044.wav|turning to more fundamental resemblances, such as the wing of a bat and the wing of a bird,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0045.wav|careful study shows detailed internal as well as external similarities of structure. such cases are "homologies".
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0046.wav|on the one hand, then, are found structures which are perfectly analogous and yet in no way homologous:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0047.wav|totally different structures are modified to perform the same functions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0048.wav|on the other hand are found structures which are perfectly homologous and yet in no way analogous:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0049.wav|the structural elements remain, but are profoundly modified to perform totally different functions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0050.wav|homology thus means identity of structure which is the result of identity of parentage. it is the stamp of heredity.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0051.wav|it means blood relationship.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0052.wav|these principles of homology are essential to a correct interpretation of the facts of morphology.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0053.wav|the most striking fact of similar structure among plants and among animals is the existence of a common general plan in any group.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0054.wav|since backboned animals are best known to most readers, they may be taken as an illustration.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0055.wav|"all vertebrate animals, and none other," says le conte, "have an internal jointed skeleton worked by muscles on the outside.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0063.wav|enlarged and consolidated to form the pelvis, to serve as a firm support to the hind limbs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0064.wav|all vertebrates, and none other, have two cavities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0065.wav|enclosed and protected by the skeleton, viz., the neural cavity above, and the visceral or body cavity below, the vertebral column.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0066.wav|all vertebrates, with few exceptions, and no other animals, have two and only two pair of limbs.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0071.wav|but much more remains which is not only suggestive, but demonstrative of such origin.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0072.wav|by extensive comparison in the taxonomic and ontogenic series, the whole vertebrate structure in all its details in different animals
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0073.wav|may be shown to be modifications one of another.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0074.wav|sometimes a piece is enlarged, sometimes diminished, or even becomes obsolete; sometimes several pieces are consolidated into one;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0075.wav|but, in spite of all these obscurations, corresponding parts usually may be made out.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0076.wav|these remarkable similarities in the common general plan alone are convincing evidences of descent,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0077.wav|but attention may be called to a like similarity extending to the details of structure.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0078.wav|for example: the wings of a bat (a mammal), a bird and a fossil flying reptile all show the same bones adaptively modified;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0082.wav|and any other series of organs of vertebrates would give the same evidence of fundamental resemblances (homologies).
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0083.wav|for such a series of facts the reader must be referred to special books like wiedersheim's "comparative anatomy of the vertebrates,"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0084.wav|romanes's "darwin and after darwin", and le conte's "evolution."
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0085.wav|the existence of great similarities in vertebrate structure is not always fully recognized.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0086.wav|to the superficial observer the bodies of animals of different classes seem to differ fundamentally in plan,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0087.wav|to be entirely different machines, made each for its own purposes, at once, out of hand.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0088.wav|extensive comparison, on the contrary, shows them to be the same, although the essential identity is obscured by adaptive modifications.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0089.wav|the simplest, in fact the only scientific, explanation of the phenomena of vertebrate structure is the idea of a primal vertebrate,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0113.wav|of course the theory of descent with adaptive modification has a simple answer to supply
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0114.wav|namely that when from changed conditions of life, an organ which was previously useful becomes useless,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0115.wav|it will be suffered to dwindle away in successive generations, under the influence of certain natural causes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0116.wav|on the other hand, the theory of special creation can only maintain that these rudiments are formed for the sake of adhering to an ideal type.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0117.wav|"now, here again the former theory appears to be triumphant over the latter," says romanes,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0119.wav|surely if such a method were adopted in so many cases, we should expect that in consistency it would be adopted in all cases.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0120.wav|this reasonable expectation, however, is far from being realized.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0121.wav|in numberless cases, such as that of the fore limbs of serpents, no vestige of a rudiment is present.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0123.wav|where within the limits of the same natural group of organisms a rudiment is sometimes present and sometimes absent.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0127.wav|while neglecting to maintain his unity of ideal in the case of nearly all the numerous species of snakes, he should have added a tiny rudiment in the case of the python

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0134.wav|most remarkable of all the principles which have been discovered by embryologists is the "recapitulation doctrine"

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0136.wav|illustrations quoted from the works of romanes and le conte will make this principle clear.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0137.wav|"it is an observable fact," says romanes,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0138.wav|that there is often a close correspondence between developmental changes as revealed by any chronological series of fossils which may happen to have been preserved,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0139.wav|and developmental changes which may be observed during the life history of now existing individuals belonging to the same group of animals.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0141.wav|is closely reproduced in the life history of existing deer. or, in other words,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0142.wav|the antlers of an existing deer furnish in their development a kind of "resume," or recapitulation, of the successive phases
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0143.wav|whereby the primitive horn was gradually superseded by horns presenting a greater and greater number of prongs in successive species of extinct deer.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0144.wav|now, it must be obvious
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0145.wav|that such a recapitulation in the life history of an existing animal of developmental changes successively distinctive of sundry allied,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0146.wav|though now extinct species, speaks strongly in favor of evolution.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0147.wav|for as it is of the essence of this theory that new forms arise from older forms by way of hereditary descent,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0149.wav|that the phases of development presented by the individual organism would follow, in their main outlines, those phases of development
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0150.wav|through which their long line of ancestors had passed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0151.wav|the only alternative view is that as species of deer,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0152.wav|for instance, were separately created, additional prongs were successively added to their antlers; and yet that,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0153.wav|in order to be so added to successive species, every individual deer belonging to later species was required to repeat in his own lifetime

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0156.wav|according to the evolutionary interpretation of such facts, we can see a very good reason why the life history of the individual

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0162.wav|the fish retains permanently this form, but the frog passes on.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0163.wav|next, it forms first one pair and then another pair of legs; and meanwhile it begins to breathe also by lungs.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0164.wav|at this stage it breathes equally by lungs and by gills i.e., both air and water.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0166.wav|retain permanently this form, and are therefore called "perennibranchs," but the frog still passes on.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ027-0167.wav|then the gills gradually dry up, as the lungs develop, and they now breathe wholly by lungs, but still retain the tail.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0216.wav|commanded him (cyrus) to go forth to his city babylon, and he went by his side as a friend and companion.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0232.wav|here they shut themselves up and made light of his siege, having laid in a store of provision for many years in preparation against this attack;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0235.wav|in this distress either someone made this suggestion to him, or he bethought himself of a plan which he proceeded to put in execution.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0238.wav|he then himself drew off with the unwarlike portion of his host, and made for the place where nitocris dug the basin for the river,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0239.wav|where he did exactly what she had done formerly: he turned the euphrates by a canal into the basin, which was then a marsh,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0242.wav|entered the stream, which had now sunk so as to reach about midway up a man's thigh, and thus got into the town.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0243.wav|had the babylonians been apprised of what cyrus was about, or had they noticed their danger, they would never have allowed the persians to enter the city,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0245.wav|and mounting upon the walls along both sides of the stream, would so have caught the enemy as it were in a trap.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0250.wav|such, then, were the circumstances of the first taking of babylon.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0251.wav|when cyrus took babylon, little or no force was employed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0252.wav|only the king's son, belshazzar, was killed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0253.wav|the city was spared; the great walls were left standing; the daily sacrifices were continued in the temples, and cyrus made his home in the royal palace.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0256.wav|during the reigns of the two following persian kings babylon was slowly regaining its independence,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0257.wav|and in five twenty one nebuchadnezzar the third, a native babylonian, was placed on the throne.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0258.wav|then the babylonians secretly plotted to throw off the persian yoke.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0259.wav|that same year, when darius hystaspes came to the persian throne, the babylonians openly rebelled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0260.wav|the following story from herodotus tells the results:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0261.wav|at last when the time came for rebelling openly they did as follows:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0262.wav|having first set apart their mothers, each man chose besides out of his whole household one woman whomsoever he pleased;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0263.wav|these alone were allowed to live, while all the rest were brought to one place and strangled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0264.wav|the women chosen were kept to make bread for the men; while the others were strangled that they might not consume the stores.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0265.wav|when tidings reached darius of what had happened,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0266.wav|he drew together all his power and began the war by marching straight upon babylon and laying siege to the place.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0267.wav|the babylonians, however, cared not a whit for his siege.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0268.wav|mounting upon the battlements that crowned their walls, they insulted and jeered at darius and his mighty host.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0269.wav|one even shouted to them and said, "why sit ye there, persians? why do ye not go back to your homes? till mules foal ye will not take our city!"
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0270.wav|this was said by a babylonian who thought that a mule would never foal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0271.wav|now when a year and seven months had passed, darius and his army were quite wearied out, finding that they could not anyhow take the city.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0273.wav|not even when he tried the means by which cyrus had made himself master of the place.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0274.wav|the babylonians were ever upon the watch, and he found no way of conquering them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0275.wav|at last, in the twentieth month,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0276.wav|a marvelous thing happened to zopyrus, son of the megabyzus who was among the seven men that overthrew the magus.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0277.wav|one of his sumpter mules gave birth to a foal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0278.wav|zopyrus, when they told him, not thinking that it could be true, went and saw the colt with his own eyes;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0279.wav|after which he commanded his servants to tell no one what had come to pass, while he himself pondered the matter.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0280.wav|calling to mind then the words of the babylonian at the beginning of the siege:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0281.wav|till mules foal ye shall not take our city, he thought, as he reflected on this speech, that babylon might now be taken,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0282.wav|for it seemed to him that there was a divine providence in the man having used the phrase, and then his mule having foaled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0283.wav|as soon therefore as he felt within himself that babylon was fated to be taken, he went to darius and asked him if he set a very high value on its conquest.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0284.wav|when he found that darius did indeed value it highly, he considered further with himself how he might make the deed his own, and be the man to take babylon.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0285.wav|noble exploits in persia are ever highly honored and bring their authors to greatness.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0286.wav|he therefore reviewed all ways of bringing the city under,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0287.wav|but found none by which he could hope to prevail, unless he maimed himself and then went over to the enemy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0288.wav|to do this seeming to him a light matter, he mutilated himself in a way that was utterly without remedy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0289.wav|for he cut off his own nose and ears, and then, clipping his hair close and flogging himself with a scourge,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0290.wav|he came in this plight before darius.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0291.wav|wrath stirred within the king at the sight of a man of his lofty rank in such a condition;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0292.wav|leaping down from his throne he exclaimed aloud and asked zopyrus who it was that had disfigured him, and what he had done to be so treated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0293.wav|zopyrus answered, "there is not a man in the world, but thou, o king, that could reduce me to such a plight

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0295.wav|i maimed myself because i could not endure that the assyrians should laugh at the persians. "wretched man," said darius,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0298.wav|surely thou hadst gone out of thy mind when thou didst so misuse thyself.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0299.wav|"had i told thee," rejoined the other, "what i was bent on doing, thou wouldst not have suffered it;

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0307.wav|then let twenty days pass, and at the end of that time station near the chaldasan gates a body of four thousand.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0308.wav|let neither these nor the former troops be armed with any weapons but their swords those thou mayest leave them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0309.wav|after the twenty days are over, bid thy whole army attack the city on every side, and put me two bodies of persians,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0310.wav|one at the belian, the other at the cissian gates; for i expect that, on account of my successes,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0311.wav|the babylonians will entrust everything, even the keys of their gates, to me. then it will be for me and my persians to do the rest.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0312.wav|having left these instructions, zopyrus fled towards the gates of the town, often looking back, to give himself the air of a deserter.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0314.wav|observing him, hastened down, and setting one of the gates slightly ajar, questioned him who he was, and on what errand he had come.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0315.wav|he replied that he was zopyrus, and deserted to them from the persians.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0316.wav|then the doorkeepers, when they heard this, carried him at once before the magistrates.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0317.wav|introduced into their assembly, he began to bewail his misfortunes, telling them that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0318.wav|darius had maltreated him in the way they could see, only because he had given advice that the siege should be raised, since there seemed no hope of taking the city.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0319.wav|"and now," he went on to say, "my coming to you, babylonians,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0326.wav|and on his suing for a command, they entrusted to him a body of troops with the help of which he proceeded to do as he had arranged with darius.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0327.wav|on the tenth day after his flight he led out his detachment, and surrounding the thousand men,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ028-0334.wav|this last victory gave him the finishing stroke to his power and made him all in all with the babylonians:

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0087.wav|when asked why he did not turn the president over, doctor carrico testified as follows:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0088.wav|this man was in obvious extreme distress and any more thorough inspection would have involved several minutes well, several

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0090.wav|a thorough inspection would have involved washing and cleansing the back, and this is not practical in treating an acutely injured patient.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0095.wav|before this was accomplished the president's cardiac activity had ceased and closed cardiac massage was instituted, which made it impossible to inspect his back.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ031-0099.wav|moreover, the parkland doctors took no further action after the president had expired because they concluded that it was beyond the scope of their permissible duties.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0121.wav|he applied fingerprint powder to the side of the metal housing near the trigger, and noticed traces of two prints.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0125.wav|in his testimony before the commission, latona stated that when he received the rifle, the area where prints were visible was protected by cellophane.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0126.wav|he examined these prints, as well as photographs of them which the dallas police had made, and concluded that:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0127.wav|the formations, the ridge formations and characteristics, were insufficient for purposes of either effecting identification
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0128.wav|or a determination that the print was not identical with the prints of people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0129.wav|accordingly, my opinion simply was that the latent prints which were there were of no value, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0130.wav|latona then processed the complete weapon but developed no identifiable prints.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0131.wav|he stated that the poor quality of the wood and the metal would cause the rifle to absorb moisture from the skin, thereby making a clear print unlikely.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0132.wav|on november twenty two, however, before surrendering possession of the rifle to the fbi laboratory,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0133.wav|lieutenant day of the dallas police department had "lifted" a palmprint from the underside of the gun barrel
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0134.wav|quote, near the firing end of the barrel about three inches under the woodstock when i took the woodstock loose, end quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0135.wav|"lifting" a print involves the use of adhesive material to remove the fingerprint powder which adheres to the original print.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0136.wav|in this way the powdered impression is actually removed from the object.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0137.wav|the lifting had been so complete in this case that there was no trace of the print on the rifle itself when it was examined by latona.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0139.wav|day, on the other hand, believed that sufficient traces of the print had been left on the rifle barrel,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0140.wav|because he did not release the lifted print until november twenty six, when he received instructions to send "everything that we had" to the fbi.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0146.wav|latona testified that this palmprint was the right palmprint of lee harvey oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0147.wav|at the request of the commission, arthur mandella,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0148.wav|fingerprint expert with the new york city police department, conducted an independent examination and also determined that this was the right palmprint of oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0149.wav|latona's findings were also confirmed by ronald g. wittmus, another fbi fingerprint expert.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0150.wav|in the opinion of these experts, it was not possible to estimate the time which elapsed between the placing of the print on the rifle and the date of the lift.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0151.wav|experts testifying before the commission agreed that palmprints are as unique as fingerprints for purposes of establishing identification.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0152.wav|oswald's palmprint on the underside of the barrel demonstrates that he handled the rifle when it was disassembled.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0153.wav|a palmprint could not be placed on this portion of the rifle, when assembled, because the wooden foregrip covers the barrel at this point.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0160.wav|he compared them with the fibers found in the shirt which oswald was wearing when arrested in the texas theatre.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0161.wav|this shirt was also composed of dark blue, gray black and orange yellow cotton fibers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0162.wav|stombaugh testified that the colors, shades, and twist of the fibers found in the tuft on the rifle matched those in oswald's shirt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0163.wav|stombaugh explained in his testimony that in fiber analysis, as distinct from fingerprint or firearms identification,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0164.wav|it is not possible to state with scientific certainty that a particular small group of fibers come from a certain piece of clothing
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0165.wav|to the exclusion of all others because there are not enough microscopic characteristics present in fibers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0166.wav|judgments as to probability will depend on the number and types of matches.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0167.wav|he concluded, quote, there is no doubt in my mind that these fibers could have come from this shirt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0168.wav|there is no way, however, to eliminate the possibility of the fibers having come from another identical shirt, end quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0169.wav|having considered the probabilities as explained in stombaugh's testimony,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0170.wav|the commission has concluded that the fibers in the tuft on the rifle most probably came from the shirt worn by oswald when he was arrested,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0171.wav|and that this was the same shirt which oswald wore on the morning of the assassination.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0172.wav|marina oswald testified that she thought her husband wore this shirt to work on that day.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0173.wav|the testimony of those who saw him after the assassination was inconclusive about the color of oswald's shirt,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0174.wav|but mary bledsoe, a former landlady of oswald, saw him on a bus approximately ten minutes after the assassination
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0175.wav|and identified the shirt as being the one worn by oswald primarily because of a distinctive hole in the shirt's right elbow.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0176.wav|moreover, the bus transfer which he obtained as he left the bus was still in the pocket when he was arrested.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0177.wav|although oswald returned to his roominghouse after the assassination and when questioned by the police, claimed to have changed his shirt,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0178.wav|the evidence indicates that he continued wearing the same shirt which he was wearing all morning and which he was still wearing when arrested.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0179.wav|in light of these findings the commission evaluated the additional testimony of stombaugh
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0180.wav|that the fibers were caught in the crevice of the rifle's butt plate, quote, in the recent past, end quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0181.wav|although stombaugh was unable to estimate the period of time the fibers were on the rifle he said that the fibers, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0182.wav|were clean, they had good color to them, there was no grease on them and they were not fragmented. they looked as if they had just been picked up, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0183.wav|the relative freshness of the fibers is strong evidence that they were caught on the rifle on the morning of the assassination or during the preceding evening.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0184.wav|for ten days prior to the eve of the assassination oswald had not been present at ruth paine's house in irving, texas, where the rifle was kept.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0185.wav|moreover, the commission found no reliable evidence that oswald used the rifle at any time between september twenty three,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0186.wav|when it was transported from new orleans, and november twenty two, the day of the assassination.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0187.wav|the fact that on the morning of the assassination oswald was wearing the shirt from which these relatively fresh fibers most probably originated,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0188.wav|provides some evidence that they were placed on the rifle that day
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0189.wav|since there was limited, if any, opportunity for oswald to handle the weapon during the two months prior to november twenty two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0190.wav|on the other hand stombaugh pointed out that fibers might retain their freshness if the rifle had been
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0191.wav|quote, put aside, end quote, after catching the fibers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0192.wav|the rifle used in the assassination probably had been wrapped in a blanket for about eight weeks prior to november twenty two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0193.wav|because the relative freshness of these fibers might be explained by the continuous storage of the rifle in the blanket,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0194.wav|the commission was unable to reach any firm conclusion as to when the fibers were caught in the rifle.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0195.wav|the commission was able to conclude, however, that the fibers most probably came from oswald's shirt.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ032-0196.wav|this adds to the conviction of the commission that oswald owned and handled the weapon used in the assassination.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0123.wav|although brennan testified that the man in the window was standing when he fired the shots, most probably he was either sitting or kneeling.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0124.wav|the half open window, the arrangement of the boxes, and the angle of the shots virtually preclude a standing position.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0125.wav|it is understandable, however, for brennan to have believed that the man with the rifle was standing. a photograph of the building taken seconds after the assassination

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0129.wav|establishes that they were either squatting or kneeling.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0130.wav|since the window ledges in the depository building are lower than in most buildings,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0131.wav|a person squatting or kneeling exposes more of his body than would normally be the case.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ034-0133.wav|brennan could have seen enough of the body of a kneeling or squatting person to estimate his height.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0086.wav|the time actually required for baker and truly to reach the second floor on november twenty two was probably longer than in the test runs. for example,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0093.wav|on the basis of this time test, therefore,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0094.wav|the commission concluded that oswald could have fired the shots and still have been present in the second floor lunchroom when seen by baker and truly.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0095.wav|that oswald descended by stairway from the sixth floor to the second floor lunchroom
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0096.wav|is consistent with the movements of the two elevators, which would have provided the other possible means of descent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0097.wav|when truly, accompanied by baker, ran to the rear of the first floor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0098.wav|he was certain that both elevators, which occupy the same shaft, were on the fifth floor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0099.wav|baker, not realizing that there were two elevators, thought that only one elevator was in the shaft and that it was two or three floors above the second floor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0100.wav|in the few seconds which elapsed while baker and truly ran from the first to the second floor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0101.wav|neither of these slow elevators could have descended from the fifth to the second floor. furthermore, no elevator was at the second floor when they arrived there.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0102.wav|truly and baker continued up the stairs after the encounter with oswald in the lunchroom.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0103.wav|there was no elevator on the third or fourth floor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0104.wav|the east elevator was on the fifth floor when they arrived; the west elevator was not.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0105.wav|they took the east elevator to the seventh floor and ran up a stairway to the roof where they searched for several minutes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0106.wav|jack dougherty, an employee working on the fifth floor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0107.wav|testified that he took the west elevator to the first floor after hearing a noise which sounded like a backfire.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0108.wav|eddie piper, the janitor, told dougherty that the president had been shot,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0109.wav|but in his testimony piper did not mention either seeing or talking with dougherty during these moments of excitement.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0110.wav|both dougherty and piper were confused witnesses. they had no exact memory of the events of that afternoon.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0111.wav|truly was probably correct in stating that the west elevator was on the fifth floor when he looked up the elevator shaft from the first floor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0112.wav|the west elevator was not on the fifth floor when baker and truly reached that floor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0113.wav|probably because jack dougherty took it to the first floor while baker and truly were running up the stairs or in the lunchroom with oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0114.wav|neither elevator could have been used by oswald as a means of descent.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0115.wav|oswald's use of the stairway is consistent with the testimony of other employees in the building.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0116.wav|three employees james jarman, junior,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0117.wav|harold norman, and bonnie ray williams were watching the parade from the fifth floor, directly below the window from which the shots were fired.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0118.wav|they rushed to the west windows after the shots were fired and remained there
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0119.wav|until after they saw patrolman baker's white helmet on the fifth floor moving toward the elevator.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0120.wav|while they were at the west windows their view of the stairwell was completely blocked by shelves and boxes.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0121.wav|this is the period during which oswald would have descended the stairs. in all likelihood
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0122.wav|dougherty took the elevator down from the fifth floor after jarman, norman, and williams ran to the west windows and were deciding what to do.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0123.wav|none of these three men saw dougherty, probably because of the anxiety of the moment and because of the books which may have blocked the view.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0124.wav|neither jarman, norman, williams, or dougherty saw oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0125.wav|victoria adams, who worked on the fourth floor of the depository building,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0126.wav|claimed that within about one minute following the shots she ran from a window on the south side of the fourth floor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0127.wav|down the rear stairs to the first floor, where she encountered two depository employees william shelley and billy lovelady.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0128.wav|if her estimate of time is correct, she reached the bottom of the stairs before truly and baker started up,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0129.wav|and she must have run down the stairs ahead of oswald and would probably have seen or heard him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0130.wav|actually she noticed no one on the back stairs. if she descended from the fourth to the first floor as fast as she claimed in her testimony,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0131.wav|she would have seen baker or truly on the first floor or on the stairs, unless they were already in the second floor lunchroom talking to oswald.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0134.wav|that they were watching the parade from the top step of the building entrance when gloria calverly, who works in the depository building,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0135.wav|ran up and said that the president had been shot.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0136.wav|lovelady and shelley moved out into the street.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0137.wav|about this time shelley saw truly and patrolman baker go into the building
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0138.wav|shelley and lovelady, at a fast walk or trot, turned west into the railroad yards and then to the west side of the depository building.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0139.wav|they reentered the building by the rear door several minutes after baker and truly rushed through the front entrance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ035-0140.wav|on entering, lovelady saw a girl on the first floor who he believes was victoria adams.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0269.wav|frazier testified, however, that he found no microscopic characteristics or other evidence
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0270.wav|which would indicate that the bullet was not fired from the mannlicher carcano rifle owned by lee harvey oswald.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0280.wav|and for purposes of probative value, for whatever it might be worth,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ038-0281.wav|in the absence of very definite negative evidence, i think it is permissible to say that in an exhibit such as five seven three

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0006.wav|the commission has considered many possible motives for the assassination, including those which might flow from oswald's commitment to marxism or communism,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0008.wav|a desire to effect changes in the structure of society or simply to go down in history as a well publicized assassin.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0009.wav|none of these possibilities satisfactorily explains oswald's act if it is judged by the standards of reasonable men.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0041.wav|there was some quality about him that led him to act with an apparent disregard for possible consequences.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0050.wav|his attachment to marxist and communist doctrine was probably, in some measure, an expression of his hostility to his environment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0051.wav|while there is doubt about how fully oswald understood the doctrine which he so often espoused, it seems clear
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0052.wav|that his commitment to marxism was an important factor influencing his conduct during his adult years.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0053.wav|it was an obvious element in his decision to go to russia and later to cuba and it probably influenced his decision to shoot at general walker.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0063.wav|significant in shaping the character of lee harvey oswald was the death of his father, a collector of insurance premiums.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0064.wav|this occurred two months before lee was born in new orleans on october eighteen, nineteen thirty nine.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0065.wav|that death strained the financial fortunes of the remainder of the oswald family.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0066.wav|it had its effect on lee's mother, marguerite, his brother robert, who had been born in nineteen thirty four,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0067.wav|and his half brother john pic, who had been born in nineteen thirty two during marguerite's previous marriage.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0068.wav|it forced marguerite oswald to go to work to provide for her family.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0069.wav|reminding her sons that they were orphans and that the family's financial condition was poor,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0070.wav|she placed john pic and robert oswald in an orphans' home.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0071.wav|from the time marguerite oswald returned to work until december twenty six, nineteen forty two, when lee too was sent to the orphans' home,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0072.wav|he was cared for principally by his mother's sister, by babysitters and by his mother, when she had time for him.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0073.wav|marguerite oswald withdrew lee from the orphans' home and took him with her to dallas when he was a little over four years old.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0075.wav|apparently that action was taken in anticipation of her marriage to edwin a. ekdahl, which took place in may of nineteen forty five.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0076.wav|in the fall of that year john pic and robert oswald went to a military academy

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0078.wav|lee oswald remained with his mother and ekdahl, to whom he became quite attached.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0079.wav|john pic testified that he thought lee found in ekdahl the father that he never had.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0080.wav|that situation, however, was short lived,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0081.wav|for the relations between marguerite oswald and ekdahl were stormy and they were finally divorced, after several separations and reunions,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0082.wav|in the summer of nineteen forty eight.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0083.wav|after the divorce misses oswald complained considerably about how unfairly she was treated,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0084.wav|dwelling on the fact that she was a widow with three children.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0085.wav|john pic, however, did not think her position was worse than that of many other people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0086.wav|in the fall of nineteen forty eight she told john pic and robert oswald
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0087.wav|that she could not afford to send them back to the military school and she asked pic to quit school entirely to help support the family.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0088.wav|which he did for four months in the fall of nineteen forty eight.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0089.wav|in order to supplement their income further she falsely swore that pic was seventeen years old so that he could join the marine corps reserves.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0090.wav|pic did turn over part of his income to his mother,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0091.wav|but he returned to high school in january of nineteen forty nine, where he stayed until three days before he was scheduled to graduate,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0092.wav|when he left school in order to get into the coast guard. since his mother did not approve of his decision to continue school
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0093.wav|he accepted the responsibility for that decision himself and signed his mother's name to all his own excuses and report cards.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0094.wav|pic thought that his mother overstated her financial problems and was unduly concerned about money.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0095.wav|referring to the period after the divorce from ekdahl, which was apparently caused in part by marguerite's desire to get more money from him,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0096.wav|pic said, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0097.wav|lee was brought up in this atmosphere of constant money problems, and i am sure it had quite an effect on him, and also robert, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0098.wav|marguerite oswald worked in miscellaneous jobs after her divorce from ekdahl.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0099.wav|when she worked for a time as an insurance saleslady,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0100.wav|she would sometimes take lee with her, apparently leaving him alone in the car while she transacted her business.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0101.wav|when she worked during the school year, lee had to leave an empty house in the morning,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0102.wav|return to it for lunch and then again at night, his mother having trained him to do that rather than to play with other children.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0103.wav|an indication of the nature of lee's character at this time was provided in the spring of nineteen fifty,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0104.wav|when he was sent to new orleans to visit the family of his mother's sister, misses lillian murret, for two or three weeks.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0105.wav|despite their urgings, he refused to play with the other children his own age.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0106.wav|it also appears that lee tried to tag along with his older brothers
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0107.wav|but apparently was not able to spend as much time with them as he would have liked, because of the age gaps of five and seven years,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0108.wav|which became more significant as the children grew older.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0109.wav|whatever problems may have been created by lee's home life in louisiana and texas,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0110.wav|he apparently adjusted well enough there to have had an average, although gradually deteriorating, school record
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0111.wav|with no behavior or truancy problems.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0112.wav|that was not the case, however, after he and his mother moved to new york in august of nineteen fifty two, shortly before lee's thirteenth birthday.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0113.wav|they moved shortly after robert joined the marines; they lived for a time with john pic who was stationed there with the coast guard.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0114.wav|relations soon became strained, however, so in late september lee and his mother moved to their own apartment in the bronx.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0116.wav|who was becoming quite a disciplinary problem for his mother, having struck her on at least one occasion.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0117.wav|the short lived stay with the pics was terminated after an incident in which lee allegedly pulled out a pocket knife during an argument
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0118.wav|and threatened to use it on misses pic.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ040-0119.wav|when pic returned home, misses oswald tried to play down the event but misses pic took a different view and asked the oswalds to leave.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0105.wav|led to an incident in which he spilled a drink on one of his sergeants and abusively challenged him to fight.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0106.wav|at the court martial hearing which followed, oswald admitted that he had been rather drunk when the incident occurred.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0107.wav|he testified that he had felt the sergeant had a grudge against him and that he had unsuccessfully sought a transfer from the sergeant's unit.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0108.wav|he said that he had simply wanted to discuss the question with the sergeant and the drink had been spilled accidentally.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0116.wav|after it was learned that he had defected to the soviet union.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0117.wav|in an attempt to have this discharge reversed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0118.wav|oswald wrote to then secretary of the navy connally on january thirty, nineteen sixty two,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0119.wav|stating that he would, quote, employ all means to right this gross mistake or injustice, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0120.wav|governor connally had just resigned to run for governor of texas, so he advised oswald that he had forwarded the letter to his successor.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0121.wav|it is thus clear that oswald knew that governor connally was never directly concerned with his discharge
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0122.wav|and he must have known that president kennedy had had nothing to do with it.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0123.wav|in that connection, it does not appear that oswald ever expressed any dissatisfaction of any kind with either the president or governor connally.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0124.wav|marina oswald testified that she, quote, had never heard anything bad about kennedy from lee. and he never had anything against him, end quote.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0127.wav|oswald must have already learned that the governor could not help him with his discharge because he was no longer secretary of the navy, at the time he made that remark.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0128.wav|even though oswald apparently did not express any hostility against the president or governor connally,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0129.wav|he continued to be concerned about his undesirable discharge. it is clear that he thought he had been unjustly treated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0130.wav|probably his complaint was due to the fact that his discharge was not related to anything he had done while on active duty
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0131.wav|and also because he had not received any notice of the original discharge proceedings, since his whereabouts were not known.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0132.wav|he continued his efforts to reverse the discharge by petitioning the navy discharge review board,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0133.wav|which finally declined to modify the discharge and so advised him in a letter dated july nineteen sixty three.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0134.wav|governor connally's connection with the discharge, although indirect, caused the commission to consider whether he might have been oswald's real target.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0135.wav|in that connection, it should be noted that marina oswald testified on september six, nineteen sixty four, that she thought her husband, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0136.wav|was shooting at connally rather than president kennedy, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0137.wav|in support of her conclusion misses oswald noted her husband's undesirable discharge
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0138.wav|and that she could not think of any reason why oswald would want to kill president kennedy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0139.wav|it should be noted, however, that at the time oswald fired the shots at the presidential limousine the governor occupied the seat in front of the president,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0140.wav|and it would have been almost impossible for oswald to have hit the governor without hitting the president first.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0141.wav|oswald could have shot the governor as the car approached the depository or as it was making the turn onto elm street.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0143.wav|the president almost completely blocked oswald's view of the governor prior to the time the first shot struck the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0144.wav|oswald would have had other and more favorable opportunities to strike at the governor than on this occasion when, as a member of the president's party,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0145.wav|he had more protection than usual. it would appear, therefore, that to the extent oswald's undesirable discharge affected his motivation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0146.wav|it was more in terms of a general hostility against the government and its representatives rather than a grudge against any particular person.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0148.wav|as indicated above, oswald started to read communist literature after he and his mother left new york and moved to new orleans.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0163.wav|out of a combination of oswald's known marxist sympathies and george orwell's book "nineteen eighty four," one of oswald's favorite books

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ041-0202.wav|oswald's commitment to marxism contributed to the decisions which led him to defect to the soviet union in nineteen fifty nine, and later

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0006.wav|he almost immediately left for the soviet union where he attempted to renounce his citizenship.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0007.wav|at the age of nineteen, oswald thus committed an act which was the most striking indication he had yet given
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0008.wav|of his willingness to act on his beliefs in quite extraordinary ways.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0009.wav|while his defection resulted in part from oswald's commitment to marxism,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0010.wav|it appears that personal and psychological factors were also involved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0011.wav|on august seventeen, nineteen sixty three, oswald told mister william stuckey,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0012.wav|who had arranged a radio debate on oswald's activities on behalf of the fair play for cuba committee,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0013.wav|that while he had begun to read marx and engels at the age of fifteen, the conclusive thing that made him decide that marxism was the answer
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0014.wav|was his service in japan.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0015.wav|he said living conditions over there convinced him something was wrong with the system, and that possibly marxism was the answer.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ042-0018.wav|on the other hand, at least one person who knew oswald after his return thought that his defection had a more personal and psychological basis.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0065.wav|oswald experienced some difficulty finding employment. perhaps this was partially because of his lack of any specific skill or training.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0075.wav|he indicated an interest in writing. an employment counselor testified, on the basis of a general aptitude test oswald had taken,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0076.wav|that he had some aptitude in that area, quote, because the verbal score is high and the clerical score is high, end quote,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0087.wav|he indicated, however, that he would have to delay that program because of his immediate financial needs and responsibilities.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0092.wav|which adhered with sufficient precision to the job specifications and as a result too much of his work had to be redone.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0094.wav|this was at least in part because of the close physical confines in which some of the work had to be done.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0099.wav|it appears that his discharge was hastened by the fact that he brought a russian language newspaper to work.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0100.wav|it is not possible to tell whether oswald did this to provide an excuse for his eventual discharge,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0102.wav|it is possible that his immediate supervisor noticed the newspaper at that time because his attention had otherwise been drawn more directly to oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ043-0103.wav|in any event, oswald was discharged on april six, nineteen sixty three, ostensibly because of his inefficiency and difficult personality.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0183.wav|to obtain a soviet visa at the soviet embassy in mexico city, he insisted that he was entitled to the cuban visa because of his background,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0192.wav|and as far as the performance of the cubans themselves was concerned, he was, quote, disappointed at not being able to get to cuba
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0193.wav|and he didn't have any great desire to do so any more because he had run into, as he himself said into bureaucracy and red tape, end quote.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0195.wav|was another act which expressed his hostility toward the united states and its institutions as well as a concomitant attachment
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0196.wav|to a country in which he must have thought were embodied the political principles to which he had been committed for so long.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0197.wav|it should be noted that his interest in cuba seems to have increased along with the sense of frustration which must have developed

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0210.wav|concerning cuban policy in general as well as on the issues of automation and civil rights, issues which appeared to concern oswald a great deal.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0211.wav|the militant also reflected a critical attitude toward president kennedy's attempts to reduce tensions between the united states and the soviet union.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0212.wav|it also dealt with the fear of the castro regime that such a policy might result in its abandonment by the soviet union.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0213.wav|the october seven, nineteen sixty three, issue of the militant
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0214.wav|reported castro as saying cuba could not accept a situation where at the same time the united states was trying to ease world tensions
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0215.wav|it also was increasing its efforts to tighten the noose around cuba.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ044-0218.wav|in this connection it should be noted that in speaking of the worker, oswald told michael paine, apparently in all seriousness, that, quote,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0190.wav|appeared in the dallas times herald on november fifteen, nineteen sixty three.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0196.wav|that fact was made precisely clear in subsequent news stories on november nineteen, twenty, and twenty two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0197.wav|on november fifteen, nineteen sixty three, the same day that his wife told him not to come to irving, oswald could have assumed

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0199.wav|whether he thought about assassinating the president over the weekend can never be known, but it is reasonably certain
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0200.wav|that over the weekend he did think about his wife's request that he not come to irving, which was prompted by the birthday party being held at the paine home.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0201.wav|oswald had a highly exaggerated sense of his own importance, but he had failed at almost everything he had ever tried to do.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0205.wav|after he returned from his trip to mexico where his application to go to cuba had been sharply rejected,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0206.wav|it must have appeared to him that he was unable to command even the attention of his family.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0207.wav|he could not keep them with him in dallas, where at least he could see his children whom, several witnesses testified, he seemed to love.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0208.wav|his family lived with misses paine, ostensibly because oswald could not afford to keep an apartment in dallas,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0210.wav|now it appeared that he was not welcome at the paine home,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0211.wav|where he had spent every previous weekend since his return from mexico and his wife was once again calling into question his judgment,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0213.wav|the conversation on monday, november eighteen, nineteen sixty three,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0214.wav|ended when marina oswald hung up and refused to talk to him. although he may long before have decided on the course he was to follow
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0215.wav|and may have told his wife the things he did on the evening of november twenty one,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0216.wav|nineteen sixty three, merely to disarm her and to provide a justification of sorts,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0217.wav|both she and misses paine thought he had come home to make up after the fight on monday.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0218.wav|thoughts of his personal difficulties must have been at least partly on his mind when he went to irving on thursday night and told his wife that he was lonely,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0219.wav|that he wanted to make peace with her and bring his family to dallas where they could live with him again.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0220.wav|the commission does not believe that the relations between oswald and his wife caused him to assassinate the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0221.wav|it is unlikely that the motivation was that simple.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0222.wav|the feelings of hostility and aggression which seem to have played such an important, part in oswald's life
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0223.wav|were part of his character long before he met his wife
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0224.wav|and such a favorable opportunity to strike at a figure as great as the president would probably never have come to him again.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0225.wav|oswald's behavior after the assassination throws little light on his motives.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0226.wav|the fact that he took so little money with him when he left irving in the morning indicates that he did not expect to get very far from dallas on his own
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0227.wav|and suggests the possibility, as did his note to his wife just prior to the attempt on general walker, that he did not expect to escape at all.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0228.wav|on the other hand, he could have traveled some distance with the money he did have and he did return to his room where he obtained his revolver.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0235.wav|the testimony of the officers present indicates that he handled himself with considerable composure during his questioning.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0236.wav|he admitted nothing that would damage him but discussed other matters quite freely.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0237.wav|his denials under questioning, which have no probative value in view of the many readily demonstrable lies he told at that time

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0239.wav|which has been set forth above, only served to prolong the period during which he was the center of the attention of the entire world.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0240.wav|many factors were undoubtedly involved in oswald's motivation for the assassination, and the commission does not believe
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0241.wav|that it can ascribe to him any one motive or group of motives.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0242.wav|it is apparent, however, that oswald was moved by an overriding hostility to his environment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0243.wav|he does not appear to have been able to establish meaningful relationships with other people. he was perpetually discontented with the world around him.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0245.wav|oswald's search for what he conceived to be the perfect society was doomed from the start.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0246.wav|he sought for himself a place in history a role as the "great man" who would be recognized as having been in advance of his times.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0247.wav|his commitment to marxism and communism appears to have been another important factor in his motivation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ045-0248.wav|he also had demonstrated a capacity to act decisively and without regard to the consequences when such action would further his aims of the moment.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0031.wav|the protective task is further complicated by the reluctance of presidents to take security precautions which might interfere with the performance of their duties,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0038.wav|the president is head of state, chief executive, commander in chief, and leader of a political party.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0039.wav|as the ceremonial head of the government the president must discharge a wide range of public duties, not only in washington but throughout the land.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0042.wav|as chief executive, the president controls the exercise of the vast, almost incalculable powers of the executive branch of the federal government.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0043.wav|as commander in chief of the armed forces, he must maintain ultimate authority over the development and disposition of our military power.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0044.wav|in accordance with george washington's maxim that americans have a government, quote, of accommodation as well as a government of laws, end quote,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0048.wav|desired by both the president and the public, it is an indispensable means of communication between the two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0049.wav|more often than not, presidential journeys have served more than one purpose at the same time: ceremonial,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0050.wav|administrative, political.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0051.wav|from george washington to john f. kennedy, such journeys have been a normal part of the president's activities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0052.wav|to promote nationwide acceptance of his administration washington made grand tours that served also to excite interest in the presidency.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0053.wav|in recent years, presidential journeys have been frequent and extensive,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0054.wav|partly because of the greater speed and comfort of travel and partly because of the greater demands made on the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0055.wav|it is now possible for presidents to travel the length and breadth of a land far larger than the united states
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0056.wav|in seventeen eighty nine in less time than it took george washington to travel from new york to mount vernon
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0057.wav|or thomas jefferson from washington to monticello.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0058.wav|during his presidency, franklin d. roosevelt made almost four hundred journeys and traveled more than three hundred fifty thousand miles.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0060.wav|and their foreign journeys have come to be accepted as normal rather than extraordinary.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0061.wav|john f. kennedy's journey to texas in november nineteen sixty three was in this tradition.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0062.wav|his friend and special assistant kenneth o'donnell, who accompanied him on his last visit to dallas,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0063.wav|stated the president's views of his responsibilities with simplicity and clarity, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0064.wav|the president's views of his responsibilities as president of the united states were that he meet the people, that he go out to their homes and see them,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0065.wav|and allow them to see him, and discuss, if possible, the views of the world as he sees it, the problems of the country as he sees them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0066.wav|and he felt that leaving washington for the president of the united states was a most necessary not only for the people, but for the president himself,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0069.wav|i think he felt very strongly that the president ought to get out of washington, and go meet the people on a regular basis. end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0070.wav|whatever their purposes presidential journeys have greatly enlarged and complicated the task of protecting the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0071.wav|the secret service and the federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies which cooperate with it,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0072.wav|have been confronted in recent years with increasingly difficult problems, created by the greater exposure of the president during his travels
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0073.wav|and the greater diversity of the audiences he must face in a world torn by conflicting ideologies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0074.wav|if the sole goal were to protect the life of the president, it could be accomplished with reasonable assurance despite the multiple roles he must play.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0075.wav|but his very position as representative of the people prevents him from effectively shielding himself from the people.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0076.wav|he cannot and will not take the precautions of a dictator or a sovereign.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0077.wav|under our system, measures must be sought to afford security without impeding the president's performance of his many functions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0078.wav|the protection of the president must be thorough but inconspicuous to avoid even the suggestion of a garrison state.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0079.wav|the rights of private individuals must not be infringed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0080.wav|if the protective job is well done, its performance will be evident only in the unexceptional fact of its success.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0082.wav|must depend upon the utmost cooperation and understanding from the public and the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0083.wav|the problem and the reasonable approach to its solution were ably stated in a memorandum prepared by fbi director j. edgar hoover
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0084.wav|for the president soon after the assassination, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0085.wav|the degree of security that can be afforded the president of the united states
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0086.wav|is dependent to a considerable extent upon the degree of contact with the general public desired by the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0087.wav|absolute security is neither practical nor possible. an approach to complete security would require the president
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0088.wav|to operate in a sort of vacuum, isolated from the general public and behind impregnable barriers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0089.wav|his travel would be in secret; his public appearances would be behind bulletproof glass. a more practical approach necessitates compromise.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0090.wav|any travel, any contact with the general public, involves a calculated risk on the part of the president and the men responsible for his protection.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0091.wav|such risks can be lessened when the president recognizes the security problem,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0092.wav|has confidence in the dedicated secret service men who are ready to lay down their lives for him
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0093.wav|and accepts the necessary security precautions which they recommend.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0094.wav|many presidents have been understandably impatient with the security precautions which many years of experience dictate
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0095.wav|because these precautions reduce the president's privacy and the access to him of the people of the country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0096.wav|nevertheless the procedures and advice should be accepted if the president wishes to have any security.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0098.wav|the history of presidential protection shows growing recognition over the years that the job must be done by able, dedicated,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0100.wav|the assassination of president kennedy demands an examination of the protective measures employed to safe guard him
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0101.wav|and an inquiry whether improvements can be made which will reduce the risk of another such tragedy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0102.wav|this section considers first the means used to locate potential sources of danger to the president in time to take appropriate precautions.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0106.wav|largely measures taken by the secret service, is considered.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0110.wav|is the identification and elimination of possible sources of danger to the president before the danger becomes actual.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0111.wav|the secret service has attempted to perform this function through the activities of its protective research section

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0126.wav|estimated that most of the material received by his office originated in this fashion
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0127.wav|or from the occasional investigations initiated by the secret service,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0128.wav|while the balance was furnished to prs by other federal agencies, with primary source being the fbi.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0135.wav|prs received items in eight thousand, seven hundred nine cases.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0136.wav|before the assassination of president kennedy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0137.wav|prs expressed its interest in receiving information on suspects in very general terms. for example,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0138.wav|prs instructed the white house mailroom, a source of much prs data,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0139.wav|to refer all communications on identified existing cases and, in addition,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0140.wav|any communication, quote, that in any way indicates anyone may have possible intention of harming the president, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0141.wav|slightly more specific criteria were established for prs personnel processing white house mail referred by the white house mailroom,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0143.wav|these instructions to prs personnel appear to be the only instance where an effort was made to reduce the criteria to writing.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0240.wav|bouck explained the failure to try to identify the individuals involved in the stevenson incident after it occurred on the ground that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ046-0241.wav|prs required a more direct indication of a threat to the president, and that there was no such indication until the president's scheduled visit to that area became known.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0047.wav|according to fain's contemporaneous memorandum and his present recollection,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0048.wav|while oswald remained somewhat evasive at this interview, he was not antagonistic and seemed generally to be settling down.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0049.wav|marina oswald, however, recalled that her husband was upset by this interview.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0050.wav|oswald again agreed to advise the fbi if he were approached under suspicious circumstances; however, he deprecated the possibility of this happening,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0051.wav|particularly since his employment did not involve any sensitive information.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0052.wav|having concluded that oswald was not a security risk or potentially dangerous or violent,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0053.wav|fain determined that nothing further remained to be done at that time and recommended that the case be placed in a closed status.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0063.wav|agent hosty was told by misses m. f. tobias, a former landlady of the oswalds at six oh two elsbeth street in dallas,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0064.wav|that other tenants had complained because oswald was drinking to excess and beating his wife.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0065.wav|this information led hosty to review oswald's file, from which he learned that oswald had become a subscriber to the worker,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0067.wav|hosty decided that the lee harvey oswald case should be reopened because of the alleged personal difficulties and the contact with the worker,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0068.wav|and his recommendation was accepted. he decided, however, not to interview marina oswald at that time, and merely determined
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0069.wav|that the oswalds were living at two one four neely street in dallas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0070.wav|on april twenty one, nineteen sixty three, the fbi field office in new york
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0071.wav|was advised that oswald was in contact with the fair play for cuba committee in new york, and that he had written to the committee
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0072.wav|stating that he had distributed its pamphlets on the streets of dallas. this information did not reach agent hosty in dallas until june.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0073.wav|hosty considered the information to be, quote, stale, unquote, by that time, and did not attempt to verify oswald's reported statement.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0078.wav|and hosty asked the new orleans fbi office to determine oswald's address and what he was doing.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0095.wav|on the next day, he asked the new orleans police to arrange for him to be interviewed by the fbi.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0100.wav|but less than completely truthful or cooperative when interrogated about the fair play for cuba committee.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0101.wav|quigley testified, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0102.wav|when i began asking him specific details with respect to his activities in the fair play for cuba committee in new orleans as to where meetings were held,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0105.wav|in quigley's judgment,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0106.wav|oswald, quote, was probably making a self serving statement in attempting to explain to me why he was distributing this literature, and for no other reason,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0107.wav|and when i got to questioning him further then he felt that his purpose had been served and he wouldn't say anything further, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0108.wav|during the interview quigley obtained background information from oswald which was inconsistent with information already in the bureau's possession.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0109.wav|when quigley returned to his office, he learned
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0110.wav|that another bureau agent, milton r. knack, had been conducting a background investigation of oswald at the request of agent hosty in dallas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0111.wav|quigley advised knack of his interview and gave him a detailed memorandum.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0112.wav|knack was aware of the facts known to the fbi and recognized oswald's false statements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0113.wav|for example, oswald claimed that his wife's maiden name was prossa
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0114.wav|and that they had been married in fort worth and lived there until coming to new orleans. he had told the new orleans arresting officers that he had been born in cuba.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0115.wav|several days later, the bureau received additional evidence that oswald had lied to agent quigley.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0116.wav|on august twenty two, it learned that oswald had appeared on a radio discussion program on august twenty one.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0117.wav|william stuckey, who had appeared on the radio program with oswald, told the bureau on august thirty
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0118.wav|that oswald had told him that he had worked and been married in the soviet union.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0119.wav|neither these discrepancies nor the fact that oswald had initiated the fbi interview
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0120.wav|was considered sufficiently unusual to necessitate another interview. alan h. belmont, assistant to the director of the fbi,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0121.wav|stated the bureau's reasoning in this way, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0122.wav|our interest in this man at this point was to determine whether his activities constituted a threat to the internal security of the country.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0123.wav|it was apparent that he had made a self serving statement to agent quigley. it became a matter of record in our files as a part of the case,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0124.wav|and if we determined that the course of the investigation required us to clarify or face him down with this information, we would do it at the appropriate time.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0125.wav|in other words, he committed no violation of the law by telling us something that wasn't true, and unless this required further investigation at that time,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0126.wav|we would handle it in due course, in accord with the whole context of the investigation. end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0127.wav|on august twenty one, nineteen sixty three, bureau headquarters instructed the new orleans and dallas field offices
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0128.wav|to conduct an additional investigation of oswald in view of the activities which had led to his arrest.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0130.wav|advised the bureau that oswald was unknown in such circles.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0131.wav|in early september nineteen sixty three
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0132.wav|the fbi transferred the principal responsibility for the oswald case from the dallas office to the new orleans office.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0134.wav|the fbi was advised by the rental agent for the oswalds' apartment in new orleans that they had moved again.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0137.wav|on october three, hosty reopened the case in dallas to assist the new orleans office.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0138.wav|he checked in oswald's old neighborhood and throughout the dallas fort worth area but was unable to locate oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0139.wav|the next word about oswald's location was a communication from the cia to the fbi on october ten,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0143.wav|the possible contact with the soviet embassy in mexico intensified the fbi's interest in learning oswald's whereabouts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0144.wav|the fbi representative in mexico city arranged to follow up this information with the cia and to verify oswald's entry into mexico.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0163.wav|according to hosty, misses paine indicated that she thought she could find out where oswald was living and would let him know.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0164.wav|at this point in the interview, hosty gave misses paine his name and office telephone number on a piece of paper.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ047-0178.wav|because she thought the fbi was in possession of a great deal of information and certainly would find it very easy to learn where oswald was living.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0011.wav|neither believed that the bureau investigation of him up to november twenty two revealed any information which would have justified referral to the secret service.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0013.wav|he indicated that he had learned his lesson,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0014.wav|was disenchanted with russia, and had a renewed concept i am paraphrasing, a renewed concept of the american free society.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0016.wav|he likewise indicated he was disenchanted with russia.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0017.wav|we satisfied ourselves that we had met our requirement, namely to find out whether he had been recruited by soviet intelligence. the case was closed.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0022.wav|answer: yes. it was a self serving interview. the visits with the soviet embassy were evidently for the purpose of securing a visa,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0023.wav|and he had told us during one of the interviews that he would probably take his wife back to soviet russia some time in the future.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0034.wav|no law enforcement agency had any information to connect oswald with the attempted shooting of general walker.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0035.wav|it was against this background and consistent with the criteria followed by the fbi prior to november twenty two
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0036.wav|that agents of the fbi in dallas did not consider oswald's presence in the texas school book depository building
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0037.wav|overlooking the motorcade route as a source of danger to the president and did not inform the secret service of his employment in the depository building.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0039.wav|that the fbi took an unduly restrictive view of its responsibilities in preventive intelligence work, prior to the assassination.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0040.wav|the commission appreciates the large volume of cases handled by the fbi
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0041.wav|six hundred thirty six thousand, three hundred seventy one investigative matters during fiscal year nineteen sixty three
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0042.wav|there were no secret service criteria which specifically required the referral of oswald's case to the secret service;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0043.wav|nor was there any requirement to report the names of defectors. however, there was much material in the hands of the fbi about oswald:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0044.wav|the knowledge of his defection, his arrogance and hostility to the united states,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0045.wav|his pro castro tendencies, his lies when interrogated by the fbi,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0046.wav|his trip to mexico where he was in contact with soviet authorities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0047.wav|his presence in the school book depository job and its location along the route of the motorcade.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0048.wav|all this does seem to amount to enough to have induced an alert agency, such as the fbi,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0049.wav|possessed of this information to list oswald as a potential threat to the safety of the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0050.wav|this conclusion may be tinged with hindsight, but
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0051.wav|it stated primarily to direct the thought of those responsible for the future safety of our presidents to the need for a more imaginative
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0052.wav|and less narrow interpretation of their responsibilities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0053.wav|it is the conclusion of the commission that, even in the absence of secret service criteria
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0054.wav|which specifically required the referral of such a case as oswald's to the secret service,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0055.wav|a more alert and carefully considered treatment of the oswald case by the bureau might have brought about such a referral.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0056.wav|had such a review been undertaken by the fbi,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0057.wav|there might conceivably have been additional investigation of the oswald case between november five and november twenty two.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0060.wav|required further attention.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0061.wav|under proper procedures knowledge of the pending presidential visit might have prompted hosty
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0062.wav|to have made more vigorous efforts to locate oswald's roominghouse address in dallas and to interview him regarding these unresolved matters.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0065.wav|the fbi instructions did not reflect fully the secret service's need for information regarding potential threats.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0163.wav|it has not been the practice of the secret service to make surveys or checks of buildings along the route of a presidential motorcade.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0164.wav|for the inauguration and certain other parades in washington where the traditional route is known to the public long in advance of the event,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0255.wav|with full possession of his mental and physical capabilities and entirely ready for the performance of his assigned duties. chief rowley testified that,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0256.wav|as a result of the investigation he ordered, he was satisfied that each of the agents performed his duties in an entirely satisfactory manner

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0259.wav|however, chief rowley did not condone the action of the off duty agents, particularly since it violated a regulation of the secret service,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0261.wav|a. employees are strictly enjoined to refrain from the use of intoxicating liquor
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0262.wav|during the hours they are officially employed at their post of duty, or when they may reasonably expect that they may be called upon to perform an official duty.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0264.wav|the special agent is officially employed and should not use liquor, until the completion of all of his official duties for the day,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0265.wav|after which time a very moderate use of liquor will not be considered a violation. however, all members of the white house detail
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0266.wav|and special agents cooperating with them on presidential and similar protective assignments are considered to be subject to call for official duty

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0273.wav|that under ordinary circumstances he would have taken disciplinary action against those agents who had been drinking in clear violation of the regulation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0274.wav|however, he felt that any disciplinary action might have given rise
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0275.wav|to an inference that the violation of the regulation had contributed to the tragic events of november twenty two.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0276.wav|since he was convinced that this was not the case, he believed that it would be unfair to the agents and their families to take explicit disciplinary measures.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0277.wav|he felt that each agent recognized the seriousness of the infraction and that there was no danger of a repetition.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0278.wav|the commission recognizes that the responsibilities of members of the white house detail of the secret service are arduous.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0279.wav|they work long, hard hours, under very great strain, and must travel frequently.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0280.wav|it might seem harsh to circumscribe their opportunities for relaxation.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0281.wav|yet their role of protecting the president is so important to the well being of the country
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0282.wav|that it is reasonable to expect them to meet very high standards of personal conduct,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0283.wav|so that nothing can interfere with their bringing to their task the finest qualities and maximum resources of mind and body.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0284.wav|this is the salutary goal to which the secret service regulation is directed,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0285.wav|when it absolutely forbids drinking by any agent accompanying the president on a trip.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0286.wav|nor is this goal served when agents remain out until early morning hours, and lose the opportunity to get a reasonable amount of sleep.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0287.wav|it is conceivable that those men who had little sleep, and who had consumed alcoholic beverages, even in limited quantities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ048-0288.wav|might have been more alert in the dallas motorcade if they had retired promptly in fort worth.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0011.wav|as described in chapter two, the president directed that his car stop on two occasions during the motorcade so that he could greet members of the public.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0017.wav|the limousine used by president kennedy in dallas was a convertible with a detachable, rigid plastic "bubble" top

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0020.wav|it was not then replaced because the state of the art did not permit the development of a bulletproof top of sufficiently light weight
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0021.wav|to permit its removal on those occasions when the president wished to ride in an open car.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0022.wav|the secret service believed that it was very doubtful that any president would ride regularly in a vehicle with a fixed top, even though transparent.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0024.wav|has developed a vehicle for the better protection of the president.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0026.wav|on occasion the secret service has been permitted to have an agent riding in the passenger compartment with the president.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0030.wav|the commission does believe that there are aspects of the protective measures employed in the motorcade at dallas which deserve special comment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0031.wav|the presidential vehicle in use in dallas, described in chapter two,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0032.wav|had no special design or equipment which would have permitted the secret service agent riding in the driver's compartment
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0033.wav|to move into the passenger section without hindrance or delay. had the vehicle been so designed it is possible that an agent riding in the front seat
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0034.wav|could have reached the president in time to protect him from the second and fatal shot to hit the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0035.wav|however, such access to the president was interfered with both by the metal bar some fifteen inches above the back of the front seat
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0036.wav|and by the passengers in the jump seats.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0038.wav|had no passenger in a jump seat between agent youngblood and vice president johnson to interfere with agent youngblood's ability
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0039.wav|to take a protective position in the passenger compartment before the third shot was fired.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0040.wav|the assassination suggests that it would have been of prime importance
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0041.wav|in the protection of the president if the presidential car permitted immediate access to the president by a secret service agent at the first sign of danger.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0044.wav|even if the car is traveling more slowly, the delay involved in reaching the president may be crucial.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0045.wav|it is clear that at the time of the shots in dallas, agent clinton j. hill leaped to the president's rescue as quickly as humanly possible.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0060.wav|but to consider any untoward circumstances as serious and to afford the president maximum protection at all times.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0061.wav|no responsibility rests upon those agents near the president for the identification or arrest of any assassin or an attacker.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0063.wav|beyond these two principles the secret service believes a detailed contingency or emergency plan is not feasible
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0064.wav|because the variations possible preclude effective planning.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0065.wav|a number of steps are taken, however, to permit appropriate steps to be taken in an emergency.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0066.wav|for instance, the lead car always is manned by secret service agents familiar with the area and with local law enforcement officials;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0067.wav|the radio net in use in motorcades is elaborate and permits a number of different means of communication with various local points.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0068.wav|a doctor is in the motorcade.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0069.wav|this basic approach to the problem of planning for emergencies is sound.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0070.wav|any effort to prepare detailed contingency plans might well have the undesirable effect of inhibiting quick and imaginative responses.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0071.wav|if the advance preparation is thorough, and the protective devices and techniques employed are sound,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0072.wav|those in command should be able to direct the response appropriate to the emergency. the commission finds that the secret service agents in the motorcade
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0073.wav|who were immediately responsible for the president's safety reacted promptly at the time the shots were fired.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0074.wav|their actions demonstrate that the president and the nation can expect courage and devotion to duty from the agents of the secret service.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0081.wav|there was no federal criminal jurisdiction over the assassination of president kennedy.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0082.wav|had there been reason to believe that the assassination was the result of a conspiracy, federal jurisdiction could have been asserted;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0083.wav|it has long been a federal crime to conspire to injure any federal officer, on account of, or while he is engaged in, the lawful discharge of the duties of his office.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0084.wav|murder of the president has never been covered by federal law, however, so that once it became reasonably clear that the killing was the act of a single person,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0086.wav|it is anomalous that congress has legislated in other ways touching upon the safety of the chief executive or other federal officers,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0100.wav|the commission recommends to the congress that it adopt legislation which would:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0101.wav|punish the murder or manslaughter of, attempt or conspiracy to murder, kidnaping of and assault upon
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0102.wav|the president, vice president, or other officer next in the order of succession to the office of president, the president elect and the vice president elect,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0103.wav|whether or not the act is committed while the victim is in the performance of his official duties or on account of such performance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0104.wav|such a statute would cover the president and vice president or, in the absence of a vice president, the person next in order of succession.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0105.wav|during the period between election and inauguration, the president elect and vice president elect would also be covered.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0106.wav|restricting the coverage in this way would avoid unnecessary controversy over the inclusion or exclusion of other officials who are in the order of succession

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0108.wav|in addition, the restriction would probably eliminate a need for the requirement which has been urged as necessary for the exercise of federal power,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0109.wav|that the hostile act occur while the victim is engaged in or because of the performance of official duties.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0130.wav|the secret service must rely in large part
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0132.wav|the commission believes that it is necessary to improve the cooperation among these agencies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0133.wav|and to emphasize that the task of presidential protection is one of broad national concern.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0134.wav|the commission suggests that consideration might be given to assigning to a cabinet level committee or the national security council
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0135.wav|(which is responsible for advising the president respecting the coordination

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0137.wav|and the other federal agencies that assist in safeguarding the president. the committee should include the secretary of the treasury and the attorney general,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0138.wav|and, if the council is used, arrangements should be made for the attendance of the secretary of the treasury

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0141.wav|the foremost assignment of the committee would be to insure that the maximum resources of the federal government are fully engaged in the job of protecting the president,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0145.wav|as improvements are recommended for the advance detection of potential threats to the president, it could act as a final review board.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0146.wav|the expert assistance and resources which it could draw upon would be particularly desirable in this complex and sensitive area.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0147.wav|this arrangement would provide a continuing high level contact for agencies that may wish to consult respecting particular protective measures.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0148.wav|for various reasons the secret service has functioned largely as an informal part of the white house staff, with the result
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0149.wav|that it has been unable, as a practical matter, to exercise sufficient influence over the security precautions which surround presidential activities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0150.wav|a cabinet level committee which is actively concerned with these problems would be able to discuss these matters more effectively with the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0151.wav|responsibilities for presidential protection
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0152.wav|the assignment of the responsibility of protecting the president to an agency of the department of the treasury was largely an historical accident.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0153.wav|the secret service was organized as a division of the department of the treasury in eighteen sixty five, to deal with counterfeiting.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0154.wav|in eighteen ninety four,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0155.wav|while investigating a plot to assassinate president cleveland, the service assigned a small protective detail of agents to the white house.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0156.wav|secret service men accompanied the president and his family to their vacation home in massachusetts
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0157.wav|and special details protected him in washington, on trips, and at special functions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0158.wav|these informal and part time arrangements led to more systematic protection in nineteen oh two, after the assassination of president mckinley;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0159.wav|the secret service, then the only federal investigative agency, assumed full time responsibility for the safety of the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0160.wav|since that time, the secret service has had and exercised responsibility for the physical protection of the president
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0161.wav|and also for the preventive investigation of potential threats against the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0162.wav|although the secret service has had the primary responsibility for the protection of the president,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0163.wav|the fbi, which was established within the department of justice in nineteen oh eight, has had in recent years an increasingly important role to play.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0164.wav|in the appropriations of the fbi there has recurred annually an item for the, quote, protection of the person of the president of the united states, end quote,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0166.wav|although the fbi is not charged with the physical protection of the president, it does have an assignment, as do other government agencies,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0167.wav|in the field of preventive investigation in regard to the president's security.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0168.wav|as discussed above, the bureau has attempted to meet its responsibilities in this field by spelling out in its handbook
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0169.wav|the procedures which its agents are to follow in connection with information received, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0170.wav|indicating the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president, end quote, or other protected persons.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0171.wav|with two federal agencies operating in the same general field of preventive investigation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0172.wav|questions inevitably arise as to the scope of each agency's authority and responsibility.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0173.wav|as the testimony of j. edgar hoover and other bureau officials revealed, the fbi did not believe that its directive required the bureau
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0174.wav|to notify the secret service of the substantial information about lee harvey oswald which the fbi had accumulated
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0175.wav|before the president reached dallas.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0176.wav|on the other hand, the secret service had no knowledge whatever of oswald, his background, or his employment at the book depository,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0177.wav|and robert i. bouck, who was in charge of the protective research section of the secret service, believed that the accumulation of the facts known to the fbi
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0178.wav|should have constituted a sufficient basis to warn the secret service of the oswald risk.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0179.wav|the commission believes that both the fbi and the secret service have too narrowly construed their respective responsibilities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0180.wav|the commission has the impression
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0181.wav|that too much emphasis is placed by both on the investigation of specific threats by individuals and not enough on dangers from other sources.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0182.wav|in addition, the commission has concluded that the secret service particularly tends to be the passive recipient of information
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0183.wav|regarding such threats and that its protective research section is not adequately staffed or equipped
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0184.wav|to conduct the wider investigative work that is required today for the security of the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0185.wav|during the period the commission was giving thought to this situation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0186.wav|the commission received a number of proposals designed to improve current arrangements for protecting the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0187.wav|these proposals included suggestions to locate exclusive responsibility for all phases of the work
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0188.wav|in one or another government agency, to clarify the division of authority between the agencies involved, and to retain the existing system
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0189.wav|but expand both the scope and the operations of the existing agencies, particularly those of the secret service and the fbi.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0190.wav|it has been pointed out that the fbi, as our chief investigative agency,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0191.wav|is properly manned and equipped to carry on extensive information gathering functions within the united states.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0192.wav|it was also suggested that it would take a substantial period of time for the secret service to build up the experience and skills necessary to meet the problem.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0193.wav|consequently the suggestion has been made, on the one hand, that all preventive investigative functions relating to the security of the president
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0194.wav|should be transferred to the fbi,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0195.wav|leaving with the secret service only the responsibility for the physical protection of the president, that is, the guarding function alone.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0196.wav|on the other hand, it is urged that all features of the protection of the president and his family should be committed to an elite and independent corps.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0197.wav|it is also contended that the agents should be intimately associated with the life of the presidential family

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0200.wav|it is suggested that an organization shorn of its power to investigate all the possibilities of danger to the president
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0201.wav|and becoming merely the recipient of information gathered by others would become limited solely to acts of physical alertness and personal courage
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0202.wav|incident to its responsibilities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0203.wav|so circumscribed, it could not maintain the esprit de corps or the necessary alertness for this unique and challenging responsibility.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0204.wav|while in accordance with its mandate
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0205.wav|this commission has necessarily examined into the functioning of the various federal agencies concerned with the tragic trip of president kennedy to dallas
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0206.wav|and while it has arrived at certain conclusions in respect thereto, it seems clear
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0207.wav|that it was not within the commission's responsibility to make specific recommendations as to the long range organization of the president's protection,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0208.wav|except as conclusions flowing directly from its examination of the president's assassination can be drawn.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0209.wav|the commission was not asked to apply itself as did the hoover commission in nineteen forty nine,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0210.wav|for examples to a determination of the optimum organization of the president's protection.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0211.wav|it would have been necessary for the commission to take considerable testimony, much of it extraneous to the facts of the assassination of president kennedy,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0212.wav|to put it in a position to reach final conclusions in this respect.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0213.wav|there are always dangers of divided responsibility,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0214.wav|duplication, and confusion of authority where more than one agency is operating in the same field; but on the other hand
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0215.wav|the protection of the president is in a real sense a government wide responsibility which must necessarily assumed by the department of state,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0217.wav|moreover, a number of imponderable questions have to be weighed if any change in the intimate association now established

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0219.wav|these considerations have induced the commission to believe
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0220.wav|that the determination of whether or not there should be a relocation of responsibilities and functions should be left to the executive and the congress,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0221.wav|perhaps upon recommendations based on further studies by the cabinet level committee recommended above or the national security council.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0222.wav|pending any such determination, however, this commission is convinced of the necessity of better coordination

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0225.wav|the commission feels the secret service and the fbi, as well as the state department and the cia when the president travels abroad,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0226.wav|could improve their existing capacities and procedures so as to lessen the chances of assassination.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0227.wav|without, therefore, coming to final conclusions respecting the long range organization of the president's security,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0228.wav|the commission believes that the facts of the assassination of president kennedy point to certain measures which,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0229.wav|while assuming no radical relocation of responsibilities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ049-0230.wav|can and should be recommended by this commission in the interest of the more efficient protection of the president.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0026.wav|the commission urges that the service continue this effort to overhaul and define its procedures.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0027.wav|while manuals and memoranda are no guarantee of effective operations,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0028.wav|no sizable organization can achieve efficiency without the careful analysis and demarcation of responsibility

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0031.wav|that the secret service consciously set about the task of inculcating and maintaining the highest standard of excellence and esprit, for all of its personnel.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0032.wav|this involves tight and unswerving discipline as well as the promotion of an outstanding degree of dedication and loyalty to duty.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0033.wav|the commission emphasizes that it finds no causal connection between the assassination
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0034.wav|and the breach of regulations which occurred on the night of november twenty one at fort worth.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0035.wav|nevertheless, such a breach, in which so many agents participated,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0036.wav|is not consistent with the standards which the responsibilities of the secret service require it to meet.

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0040.wav|and reports from other agencies which independently evaluate their information for potential sources of danger.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0041.wav|this was the consequence of the service's lack of an adequate investigative staff,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0042.wav|its inability to process large amounts of data, and its failure to provide specific descriptions of the kind of information it sought.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0043.wav|the secret service has embarked upon a complete overhaul of its research activities. the staff of the protective research section (prs)
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0044.wav|has been augmented, and a secret service inspector has been put in charge of this operation. with the assistance of the president's office of science and technology,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0045.wav|and of the advanced research projects agency of the department of defense,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0046.wav|it has obtained the services of outside consultants, such as the rand corporation,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0051.wav|nineteen sixty four, makes several significant recommendations in this field.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0052.wav|based on the commission's investigation, the following minimum goals for improvements are indicated:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0053.wav|broader and more selective criteria
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0054.wav|since the assassination, both the secret service and the fbi have recognized
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0055.wav|that the prs files can no longer be limited largely to persons communicating actual threats to the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0056.wav|on december twenty six, nineteen sixty three, the fbi circulated additional instructions to all its agents,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0057.wav|specifying criteria for information to be furnished to the secret service in addition to that covered by the former standard,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0058.wav|which was the possibility of an attempt against the person or safety of the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0059.wav|he new instructions require fbi agents to report immediately information concerning, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0060.wav|subversives, ultrarightists, racists and fascists (a) possessing emotional instability or irrational behavior,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0061.wav|(b) who have made threats of bodily harm against officials or employees of federal, state or local government or officials of a foreign government,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0066.wav|the volume of references to the secret service has increased substantially since the new instructions went into effect;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0067.wav|more than five thousand names were referred to the secret service in the first four months of nineteen sixty four.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0068.wav|according to chief rowley, by mid june nineteen sixty four,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0069.wav|the secret service had received from the fbi some nine thousand reports on members of the communist party.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0070.wav|the fbi now transmits information on all defectors, a category which would, of course, have included oswald.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0071.wav|both director hoover and belmont expressed to the commission the great concern of the fbi, which is shared by the secret service,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0072.wav|that referrals to the secret service under the new criteria might, if not properly handled,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0073.wav|result in some degree of interference with the personal liberty of those involved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0074.wav|they emphasized the necessity that the information now being furnished be handled with judgment and care.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0075.wav|the commission shares this concern.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0076.wav|the problem is aggravated by the necessity that the service obtain the assistance of local law enforcement officials in evaluating the information which it receives
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0077.wav|and in taking preventive steps.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0078.wav|in june nineteen sixty four, the secret service sent to a number of federal law enforcement and intelligence agencies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0079.wav|guidelines for an experimental program to develop more detailed criteria.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0080.wav|the suggestions of federal agencies for revision of these guidelines were solicited.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0081.wav|the new tentative criteria are useful in making clear that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0082.wav|the interest of the secret service goes beyond information on individuals or groups threatening to cause harm or embarrassment to the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0083.wav|information is requested also concerning individuals or groups who have demonstrated an interest in the president
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0084.wav|or, quote, other high government officials in the nature of a complaint coupled with an expressed or implied determination to use a means,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0085.wav|other than legal or peaceful, to satisfy any grievance, real or imagined.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0086.wav|under these criteria, whether the case should be referred to the secret service depends on the existence of a previous history of mental instability,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0087.wav|propensity toward violent action, or some similar characteristic, coupled with some evaluation of the capability of the individual or group
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0088.wav|to further the intention to satisfy a grievance by unlawful means.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0089.wav|while these tentative criteria are a step in the right direction,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0090.wav|they seem unduly restrictive in continuing to require some manifestation of animus against a government official.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0091.wav|it is questionable whether such criteria would have resulted in the referral of oswald to the secret service.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0092.wav|chief rowley believed that they would,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0093.wav|because of oswald's demonstrated hostility toward the secretary of the navy in his letter of january thirty, nineteen sixty two. quote,

C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0114.wav|and the respective responsibilities for any further investigation that may be required.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0115.wav|this is especially necessary with regard to the fbi and cia,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0116.wav|which carry the major responsibility for supplying information about potential threats,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0117.wav|particularly those arising from organized groups, within their special jurisdiction.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0118.wav|since these agencies are already obliged constantly to evaluate the activities of such groups,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0119.wav|they should be responsible for advising the secret service if information develops indicating the existence of an assassination plot
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0120.wav|and for reporting such events as a change in leadership or dogma which indicate that the group may present a danger to the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0121.wav|detailed formal agreements embodying these arrangements should be worked out between the secret service and both of these agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0122.wav|it should be made clear that the secret service will in no way seek to duplicate the intelligence
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0123.wav|and investigative capabilities of the agencies now operating in this field but will continue
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0124.wav|to use the data developed by these agencies to carry out its special duties.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0125.wav|once experience has been gained in implementing such agreements with the federal and leading state and local agencies,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0126.wav|the secret service, through its field offices,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0127.wav|should negotiate similar arrangements with such other state and local law enforcement agencies as may provide meaningful assistance.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0128.wav|much useful information will come to the attention of local law enforcement agencies in the regular course of their activities,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0129.wav|and this source should not be neglected by undue concentration on relationships with other federal agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0130.wav|finally, these agreements with federal and local authorities will be of little value
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0131.wav|unless a system is established for the frequent formal review of activities thereunder. in this regard
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0132.wav|the commission notes with approval several recent measures taken and proposed by the secret service to improve its liaison arrangements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0133.wav|in his testimony secretary of the treasury c. douglas dillon informed the commission
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0134.wav|that an interagency committee has been established to develop more effective criteria.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0135.wav|according to secretary dillon,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0136.wav|the committee will include representatives of the president's office of science and technology, department of defense, cia,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0137.wav|fbi, and the secret service.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0138.wav|in addition, the department of the treasury has requested five additional agents for its protective research section
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0139.wav|to serve as liaison officers with law enforcement and intelligence agencies. on the basis of the department's review during the past several months,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0140.wav|secretary dillon testified that the use of such liaison officers is the only effective way to insure that adequate liaison is maintained.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0141.wav|as a beginning step to improve liaison with local law enforcement officials, the secret service on august twenty six, nineteen sixty four,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0142.wav|directed its field representatives to send a form request for intelligence information to all local,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0143.wav|county, and state law enforcement agencies in their districts.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0144.wav|each of these efforts appears sound,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0145.wav|and the commission recommends that these and the other measures suggested by the commission be pursued vigorously by secret service.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0146.wav|automatic data processing
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0147.wav|unless the secret service is able to deal rapidly and accurately with a growing body of data,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0148.wav|the increased information supplied by other agencies will be wasted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0149.wav|prs must develop the capacity to classify its subjects on a more sophisticated basis than the present geographic breakdown.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0150.wav|its present manual filing system is obsolete;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0151.wav|it makes no use of the recent developments in automatic data processing which are widely used in the business world and in other government offices.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0152.wav|the secret service and the department of the treasury now recognize this critical need.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0153.wav|in the planning document currently under review by the bureau of the budget, the department recommends that it be permitted to hire five qualified persons, quote,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0154.wav|to plan and develop a workable and efficient automated file and retrieval system, end quote.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0155.wav|also the department requests the sum of one hundred thousand dollars to conduct a detailed feasibility study;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0156.wav|this money would be used to compensate consultants, to lease standard equipment or to purchase specially designed pilot equipment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0157.wav|on the basis of such a feasibility study,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0158.wav|the department hopes to design a practical system which will fully meet the needs of the protective research section of the secret service.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0159.wav|the commission recommends that prompt and favorable consideration be given to this request.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0160.wav|the commission further recommends that the secret service coordinate its planning as closely as possible with all of the federal agencies from which it receives information.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0161.wav|the secret service should not and does not plan to develop its own intelligence gathering facilities to duplicate the existing facilities of other federal agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0162.wav|in planning its data processing techniques,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0163.wav|the secret service should attempt to develop a system compatible with those of the agencies from which most of its data will come. note:
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0164.wav|in evaluating data processing techniques of the secret service,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0165.wav|the commission had occasion to become informed, to a limited extent, about the data processing techniques of other federal intelligence and law enforcement agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0166.wav|the commission was struck by the apparent lack of effort, on an interagency basis,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0167.wav|to develop coordinated and mutually compatible systems, even where such coordination would not seem inconsistent
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0168.wav|with the particular purposes of the agency involved. the commission recognizes that this is a controversial area
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0169.wav|and that many strongly held views are advanced in resistance to any suggestion that an effort be made to impose any degree of coordination.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0170.wav|this matter is obviously beyond the jurisdiction of the commission,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0171.wav|but it seems to warrant further study before each agency becomes irrevocably committed to separate action.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0172.wav|the commission, therefore, recommends that the president consider ordering an inquiry into the possibility
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0173.wav|that coordination might be achieved to a greater extent than seems now to be contemplated, without interference with the primary mission of each agency involved.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0174.wav|protective research participation in advance arrangements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0175.wav|since the assassination, secret service procedures have been changed to require that a member of prs accompany each advance survey team
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0176.wav|to establish liaison with local intelligence gathering agencies and to provide for the immediate evaluation of information received from them.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0177.wav|this prs agent will also be responsible for establishing an informal local liaison committee
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0178.wav|to make certain that all protective intelligence activities are coordinated.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0179.wav|based on its experience during this period, the secret service now recommends that additional personnel be made available to prs
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0180.wav|so that these arrangements can be made permanent without adversely affecting the operations of the service's field offices.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0181.wav|the commission regards this as a most useful innovation and urges that the practice be continued.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0182.wav|liaison with local law enforcement agencies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0183.wav|advice by the secret service to local police in metropolitan areas relating to the assistance expected in connection with a presidential visit
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0184.wav|has hitherto been handled on an informal basis.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0185.wav|the service should consider preparing formal explanations of the cooperation anticipated during a presidential visit to a city,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0186.wav|in formats that can be communicated to each level of local authorities.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0187.wav|thus, the local chief of police could be given a master plan, prepared for the occasion, of all protective measures to be taken during the visit;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0188.wav|each patrolman might be given a prepared booklet of instructions explaining what is expected of him. the secret service has expressed concern
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0189.wav|that written instructions might come into the hands of local newspapers, to the prejudice of the precautions described.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0190.wav|however, the instructions must be communicated to the local police in any event and can be leaked to the press whether or not they are in writing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0191.wav|more importantly, the lack of carefully prepared and carefully transmitted instructions for typical visits to cities
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0192.wav|can lead to lapses in protection, such as the confusion in dallas about whether members of the public were permitted on overpasses.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0193.wav|such instructions will not fit all circumstances, of course,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0194.wav|and should not be relied upon to the detriment of the imaginative application of judgment in special cases.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0195.wav|inspection of buildings
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0196.wav|since the assassination of president kennedy, the secret service has been experimenting with new techniques in the inspection of buildings along a motorcade route.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0197.wav|according to secretary dillon,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0198.wav|the studies indicate that there is some utility in attempting to designate certain buildings as involving a higher risk than others.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0199.wav|the commission strongly encourages these efforts to improve protection along a motorcade route.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0200.wav|the secret service should utilize the personnel of other federal law enforcement offices
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0201.wav|in the locality to assure adequate manpower for this task, as it is now doing.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0202.wav|lack of adequate resources is an unacceptable excuse for failing to improve advance precautions
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0203.wav|in this crucial area of presidential protection.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0204.wav|secret service personnel and facilities
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0205.wav|testimony and other evidence before the commission
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0206.wav|suggest that the secret service is trying to accomplish its job with too few people and without adequate modern equipment.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0207.wav|although chief rowley does not complain about the pay scale for secret service agents,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0208.wav|salaries are below those of the fbi and leading municipal police forces.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0209.wav|the assistant to the director of the fbi testified that
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0210.wav|the caseload of each fbi agent averaged twenty to twenty five, and he felt that this was high.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0211.wav|chief rowley testified that the present workload of each secret service agent averages one hundred ten point one cases.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0212.wav|while these statistics relate to the activities of secret service agents stationed in field offices and not the white house detail,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0213.wav|field agents supplement those on the detail, particularly when the president is traveling.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0214.wav|although the commission does not know whether the cases involved are entirely comparable,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0215.wav|these figures suggest that the agents of the secret service are substantially overworked.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0216.wav|in its budget request for the fiscal year beginning july one, nineteen sixty four,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0217.wav|the secret service sought funds for twenty five new positions, primarily in field offices. this increase has been approved by the congress.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0218.wav|chief rowley explained that this would not provide enough additional manpower to take all the measures which he considers required.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0219.wav|however, the nineteen sixty four to sixty five budget request was submitted in november nineteen sixty three
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0220.wav|and requests for additional personnel were not made because of the studies then being conducted.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0221.wav|the secret service has now presented its recommendations to the bureau of the budget. the plan proposed by the service
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0222.wav|would take approximately twenty months to implement and require expenditures of approximately three million dollars during that period.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0223.wav|the plan provides for an additional two hundred five agents for the secret service. seventeen of this number are proposed for the protective research section;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0224.wav|one hundred forty five are proposed for the field offices to handle the increased volume of security investigations
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0225.wav|and be available to protect the president or vice president when they travel;
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0226.wav|eighteen agents are proposed for a rotating pool which will go through an intensive training cycle and also be available to supplement the white house detail
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0227.wav|in case of unexpected need; and twenty five additional agents are recommended to provide the vice president full protection.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0228.wav|the commission urges that the bureau of the budget review these recommendations with the secret service and authorize a request for the necessary supplemental appropriation,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0229.wav|as soon as it can be justified. the congress has often stressed that it will support any reasonable request for funds for the protection of the president.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0230.wav|manpower and technical assistance from other agencies
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0231.wav|before the assassination the secret service infrequently requested other federal law enforcement agencies to provide personnel
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0232.wav|to assist in its protection functions.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0233.wav|since the assassination, the service has experimented with the use of agents borrowed for short periods from such agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0234.wav|it has used other treasury law enforcement agents on special experiments in building and route surveys in places to which the president frequently travels.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0235.wav|it has also used other federal law enforcement agents during presidential visits to cities in which such agents are stationed.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0236.wav|thus, in the four months following the assassination,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0237.wav|the fbi, on sixteen separate occasions, supplied a total of one hundred thirty nine agents to assist in protection work during a presidential visit,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0238.wav|which represents a departure from its prior practice.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0239.wav|from february eleven through june thirty, nineteen sixty four,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0240.wav|the service had the advantage of nine thousand, five hundred hours of work by other enforcement agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0241.wav|the fbi has indicated that it is willing to continue to make such assistance available,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0242.wav|even though it agrees with the secret service that it is preferable for the service to have enough agents to handle all protective demands.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0243.wav|the commission endorses these efforts to supplement the service's own personnel by obtaining, for short periods of time,
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0244.wav|the assistance of trained federal law enforcement officers.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0245.wav|in view of the ever increasing mobility of american presidents, it seems unlikely that the service could or should increase its own staff to a size
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0246.wav|which would permit it to provide adequate protective manpower for all situations.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0247.wav|the commission recommends that the agencies involved determine how much periodic assistance they can provide, and that each such agency
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0248.wav|and the secret service enter into a formal agreement defining such arrangements.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0249.wav|it may eventually be desirable to codify the practice in an executive order.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0250.wav|the secret service will be better able to plan its own long range personnel requirements if it knows with reasonable certainty
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0251.wav|the amount of assistance that it can expect from other agencies.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0252.wav|the occasional use of personnel from other federal agencies to assist in protecting the president has a further advantage. it symbolizes the reality
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0253.wav|that the job of protecting the president has not been and cannot be exclusively the responsibility of the secret service.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0254.wav|the secret service in the past has sometimes guarded its right to be acknowledged as the sole protector of the chief executive.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0255.wav|this no longer appears to be the case.
C:/Users/User/PycharmProjects/GradTTS/LJSpeech-1.1/wavs/LJ050-0256.wav|protecting the president is a difficult and complex task which requires full use of the best resources of many parts of our government.
